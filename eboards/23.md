Lists, revisited
----------------

* Old model
    * Create with (list ...)
    * Create with (make-list N val)
    * Create new from old with map, e.g., (map increment lst)
    * Create new list with iota
    * Reverse
    * Create a new list by removing elements from the front of a list with drop
    * Do something with each element with for-each
    * join together with append
* New model
    * All of the above plus:
    * Create a new list by adding one element to the front with 
      (cons val lst)
    * Create the empty list with 
      null or '()
    * Get the first element of a list with car
    * Get all but the first element with cdr
    * The four operations: cons, cdr, car, null are all you need to work with
      lists
