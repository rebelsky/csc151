Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Our graders would like you to know that all the writeups should go to 
  me, not to them.  (Assignments, on the other hand, go to the graders.)
* It's a new week, it must be time for new partners!
    * This week's policy: Mixed-sex groups, as much as possible.
    * Next week's policy: Same-sex groups, similar confidence levels.
        * Expect a confidence-level survey soon.
* I sent you a grade status report this morning.  
    * I'll try to send those weekly, probably on Sunday nights.
    * At some point, they'll include a bit of computation.
* Quizzes were definitely mixed.  Don't stress out about it too much.
* A few of you are having some trouble with homework partners who don't 
  make meetings.  If a partner doesn't make a meeting, the other two 
  should still make progress, so feel free to work on it without them.  
    * If, when you submit an assignment, you feel that your partner has not 
      contributed enough, let me know when you submit your assignment.
* Extra credit: 
    * Convocation, Wednesday, noon, JRC 101 (Putin and Pussy Riot)
    * CS Extras, Wednesday at 4:30 in Science 3821: AppDev
    * CS Table, Friday at noon in the Day PDR: NP Completeness

### Upcoming Work

* Tuesday's readings: Output in Scheme and Basic Image Procedures
* Today's writeup (due Wednesday): Exercise 2a from Testing
    * Email subject:
      CSC 151 Writeup 6: Testing (YOUR NAME(s) HERE)
* Homework 3 is due Tuesday night.
* Exam 1 will be distributed in class Wednesday (or maybe tomorrow).

### Neighbors

See sample code (which Sam may insert)

### Questions on HW3 (or whatever)

Why test?
---------

* Evidence suggests that we don't think deeply enough about how
  our work might fail.
* Good programmers start to think deeply about the different kinds
  of inputs we might try
* Trying lots of inputs is tedious
