### Questions

_I hear that both classes have an extension on the exam until Friday
 of finals week.  Is that really true?_

> No.  Somone probably hates you and wants you to fail.

_My week is a bit busier than I anticipated.  Can I have an extension?_

> Yes, provided you send me an email message.  It should be titled
  "CSC 151 EXTENSION!" or something similar.

_How much?_

> Pick one: Tuesday at 10:30 p.m., Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., 
  Thursday at 10:30 p.m.

_I have a question that only applies to me.  Should I ask it now?_

> No.

_Is it appropriate to make fun of students in class?_

> Probably not, but I have too many students next semester and want to
  scare some away.

_How do we submit our exam?_

> As an attachment!

_Will sorting be on the final?_

> Probably.
