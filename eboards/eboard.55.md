    * Questions.
* The subject matter(s) of the course.
* Course evaluation.
* Final comments.

Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Friday's class is optional.  But I'll bring cookies.
* Permission forms.
* You should have received an evaluation of your project this morning.
    * Since I was unable to evaluate your proposals in a timely fashion,
      I've given you all fifteen points for the proposals.
    * You can challenge my comments.
    * Having your image vary in multiple ways is not a guarantee that
      you have 1000 different images.
        * 10 color schemes
        * 5 shapes
        * 10 background color blends
        * 4 starting positions
        * But: Each decided with (mod n _), so repeats itself every 20.
* Grading to go: Quizzes, lots of daily writeups, extra credit.  Done tonight.

### Extra Credit

* Chen talk, today, 4:15 pm, BCA 152: The Role of the Creatively Maladjusted.
* Orchestra, tonight, 7:30 pm.
* Pub quiz, tonight at 9 pm, the normal stuff.
* CS Table Friday: Informal chat.
* Improv at a time to be improvised.
* Neverland study break Tuesday the 13th at 9 or something.

### Questions

The subject matter(s) of the course
-----------------------------------

Scheme

* Syntax of functions (lambdas)
* Vectors and how to use them.
* How to create images in Scheme
* Check your parentheses
* Lots and lots of Scheme syntax: lets, letrec, define, lambdas, loops,
  conditionals, data types, ...
* Lots and lots of functions
     * Standard: list-ref, vector-ref, car, cons
     * Class-specific: image-compute

Algorithms

* "The literature"
     * Binary search
     * Sequential search
     * Insertion sort
     * Selection sort
     * Merge sort
* Components of an algorithm
     * repetion (recursion or iteration)
* Remainder turns out to be fairly useful or important.
* There are techniques for analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm (and it's
  a good idea to apply)
     * There can be better ways to do things
* It's helpful to draw or write things out when problem solving.

Functional Problem Solving

* Anonymous procedures
* Higher order procedures - Look for patterns and generalize.
* Sectioning

More General CS Concepts

* Recursion - A way to write algorithms and to design/describe data
* Problem solving
* Look for patterns and generalize.
* Ways to organize data
    * Vectors
    * Pairs and trees
    * Lists
    * Collections of lists and such
* Storage of data.  (E.g., ASCII and Unicode.)
* CS requires other skills (e.g., creativity)
* Objects
* You don't have to be a cold-hearted humanoid robot to do CS.
* Documenting is a good idea.

General Skills

* It's helpful to draw or write things out when problem solving.
* Thinking on your feet
* It's okay to say "I'm not sure, come back to me later."
* Teamwork and how to deal with different approaches to the same issue.
* Problem solving
    * And the corresponding trouble shooting
* You can write programs to do tedious work for you
* There's more than one way to solve a problem; Even if you've solved it once,
  you might look for better ways.
* Techniques for generalizing, and the habit of generalizing

And Beyond

* Computers are sentient and malicious.  When things go wrong, it's not usually
  your fault.
    * And they will crash at the least convienient time possible, so save your
      work.  (Note: The cloud goes down, too.)
* Snark is Sam's approach to life in general.
* Time management.
    * Break up large amounts of work into smaller parts.
    * Know when to stop.
* Don't be afraid of asking for help
* To think ouside of the box, you have to understand the box first
* Spelling is not optional 
* Care about each other
* "There's more to life than CS" (or any academic pursuit)
* There are lots cool things on campus both academic and non-academic; take
  advantage of them.

Miscellaneous

* We can write programs that create images
* How to use Gimp.  (There are legal free not as usable alternatives to photoshop)
* GitHub - We can save our data in the cloud and also save a log of our work.
