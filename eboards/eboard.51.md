### Questions

_Are you really okay that I take an extension on the exam?  My Tutorial
 prof has fifteen things due next week._

> Yes.  But I won't have grading done by Friday.  You still have to do
  the prologue by this Friday.  Let me know how much of an extension you
  want.

_Can I take the final exam during Curtsinger's final time?_

> Yes.

_When is it?_

> Friday, 2-5 p.m.

_Really?_

> Yes.

_How about another time?_

> Sure.  I'd love to write a fourth exam.  (More seriously, I am happy
  to arrange another exam time.)

_Do we need recursion to write `tree-map`?_

> As far as I know, the only way to solve it is with recursion.

_Helper recursion, with a "so-far"?_

> NO!  Use direct recursion with trees.

_`display-file` seems really trivial if we can call `read-file`.  Is
  that okay?_

> Yes.

_Sam, you may be nice, but you're an idiot.  We can't use the `map`
 procedure you wrote for some of the problems._

> Whoops.  I'll fix it soon.  And you are now at 7 units of extra credit.

Lab
---

On exercise 1, when you insert the code to display stuff, do it within
the kernel, right above the `if`.

Writeup: Exercise 4.  It will be much easier if you do 1-3.
