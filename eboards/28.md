_Finding the Largest Element_

    (define largest
      (lambda (lst)
        (if (null? (cdr lst))
            (car lst)
            (max (car lst) (largest (cdr lst))))))

Helper recursion; Keep track of intermediate result (typcially "best solution
so far" or "partial computation") and remaining values
vs.

    (define largest
      (lambda (lst)
        (largest-helper (car lst) (cdr lst))))

    (define largest-helper
      (lambda (largest-so-far remaining)
        (if (null? remaining)
            largest-so-far
            (largest-helper (max largest-so-far (car remaining))
                            (cdr remaining)))))

vs.

    (define largest-helper
      (lambda (largest-so-far remaining)
        (if (null? remaining)
            largest-so-far
            (if (> (car remaining) largest-so-far)
                (largest-helper (car remaining) (cdr remaining))
                (largest-helper largest-so-far (cdr remaining))))))

vs.

    (define largest-helper
      (lambda (largest-so-far remaining)
        (if (null? remaining)
            largest-so-far
            (largest-helper (if (> (car remaining) largest-so-far)
                                (car remaining)
                                largest-so-far)
                            (cdr remaining)))))

vs.

     (define largest-helper
       (lambda (largest-so-far remaining)
         (cond
           [(null? remaining) 
            largest-so-far]
           [(> (car remaining) largest-so-far)
            (largest-helper (car remaining) (cdr remaining))]
           [else
            (largest-helper largest-so-far (cdr remaining))])))

_Thinking About Helper Recursion_

* Focus on the helper: 
    * Intermediate result - Likely to be close to the expected output
    * Remaining items
    * Big question: How do we update the intermediate result?
* Sometimes good to run examples

"Count the number of color names that include the word "green""

    (helper 0 '("red" "green" "blue" "lightgreen" "yellow" "greenish"))
    (helper 0 '("green" "blue" "lightgreen" "yellow" "greenish"))
    (helper 1 '("blue" "lightgreen" "yellow" "greenish"))
    (helper 1 '("lightgreen" "yellow" "greenish"))
    (helper 2 '("yellow" "greenish"))

If the car of the list includes the word green, add 1 to the counter
If the car of the list does not incldue the word green, don't change the counter

    (define helper
       (lambda (count remaining)
          (cond
            [(null remaining) count]
            [(string-contains? (car remaining) "green")
             (helper (+ 1 count) (cdr remaining))]
            [else (helper count (cdr remaining))])))

Verifying preconditions
-----------------------

* What happens if we call largest on the empty list?
    * Break, perhaps in unhelpful way
* We'd like to report an error in a helpful way

The error  procedure
--------------

(define helpful-largest
  (lambda (lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        (error "helpful-largest expects a nonempty list")
        (if (null? (cdr lst))
            (car lst)
            (max (car lst) (helpful-largest (cdr lst)))))))

Good programming style: Predict likely incorrect input and tell user about it

Husk and Kernel programming
---------------------------

* Each time we write a procedure, we write two versions/parts
    * One part does the real work, assuming that the parameters are correct
      "Colonel" -> "Kernel"
    * Another part does all of the checking
       * All succeed: Call the kernel to do the real work
       * Some fail: Report an error
* Husk and kernel programming
