### Questions re Exam

_Clarification: Can we use conditionals?_

> You haven't learned conditionals in this class.  So NO!

_What do we mean by implement?_

> Write the procedure.  (I will try to clarify in the exam.)

_For the miltary to civilian time, do we only have to deal with whole numbers?_

> Yes.

_When you ask about the effects on our checkboard, can we answer in English
or should we write code?_

> English.

_Will you grade us on concision in addition to correctness?_

> I look primarily at correctness, but really muddled code is likely to lose 
points (not least because I may not be able to tell that it's correct).

_In part B, should we group the orignial and new drawing?_

> No.  I just want the newly computed drawing.

_Do we have to code the white rectangle in the back of the ellipses?_

> No  They were just rendered on a white background.

_What do you mean by format the code more clearly?_

> Indent in such a way that the arguments to a procedure are clear.  And
follow the conventions you've seen us use.
