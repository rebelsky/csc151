### Notes on Exam 1

* To be returned at the end of class.
* Exam notes distributed via email.
* A few of you did really poorly.  It makes no sense for you to go on to
  take exam 2 until you understand the material on exam 1.  I will provide
  you with a makeup exam.  You should come see me for help.  We'll
  negotiate an appropriate due date for exam 2 (probably Thursday after
  break).
* It's *really* frustrating to take off points because people didn't do
  the epilogue.  There's a reason I give you the checklist.
* Please don't discuss your grade with other people.  (Discuss problems,
  but not grades.)
* Some good notes from the epilogues.
    * "Start early, start early, start early"
    * Keep scratch paper nearby and work out the details on paper.
    * Move on to the next question if I get stuck.
        * *And send Sam email*
    * Look back on past readings
    * Ask Sam more questions, and ask Sam questions early on.
    * Be well rested.
