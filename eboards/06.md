* Note: Sometimes the html versions of the eboards don't get updated 
  right after class.  You can always see what I typed by going to the 
  original source.

_Homework Questions_

* Should we use procedures?  **No!**

_Clicker Questions_

* Some questions on drawings
* Why is the drawing black not blue?

        #lang racket
        (require gigls/unsafe)
        (define d1 (drawing-scale drawing-unit-circle 15))
        (drawing-recolor d1 "blue")
        (define d2 (drawing-recolor (drawing-vshift d1 20) "red"))
        (define d3 (drawing-group d1 d2))
        (image-show (drawing->image d3 40 40))

    * Because drawing-recolor creates a *new* circle, it doesn't affect
      the other one

        (define x 5)
        (square x)
        x
