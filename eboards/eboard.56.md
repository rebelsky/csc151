Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Review sessions Sunday at 8 p.m., Monday at 8 p.m.  A chance to ask about 
  the sample final (except for nest).
* Although it is not national pipe cleaner day, I brought you some
  chenille stems to play with.  Do not leave them around for custodial
  staff to deal with.
* A few students in the two sections had enough overload or other issues that
  they have significant extensions.  Please limit your discussions about 
  exam 4 or the final to (a) meetings with faculty, (b) meetings with
  individual tutors, (c) private meetings that cannot be overheard, with
  people you know have completed the corresponding exam.
    * I don't like threats, and I trust you.  Nonetheless, experience 
      suggests that I must note that if you violate these rules, I
      will consider it both a significant violation of class policies
      (warranting an F in the course) and academically dishonest
      (warranting a report to the Committee on Academic Standing).
* We will discuss the final exam at the end of class.  You need not stay
  for the discussion of the final.
* Because you did not receive feedback on your homework and you did not
  receive grades on your last two assignments, I will also compute your
  grade without counting homework and use the higher of the two numeric
  grades.  (If homework helps your grade, it counts.  If it hurts your
  grade, it doesn't count.)
* I no longer have office hours this semester.  But if my door is open,
  you can stop by.  (I may sometimes say "I'm too busy.")  You can also
  ask to schedule an appointment.
* In at least one case on the exams that I looked at, I saw code that was
  clearly copied and not cited.  Please recheck.
* In at least one case on the exams that I looked at, I saw sample output
  that did not match what I got.  Please recheck.
