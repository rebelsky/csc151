Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Welcome back to CSC 151!  I'm still Sam.  Our mentors are still Erin 
  and Zachary.
* Mr. Stone will be handing out account information today.  I will use
  that as our daily attendance.
* As of 9:30 a.m. this morning, our Web server was down.  I'm not sure
  whether or not it will be up for class.  
* I use online signup for my office hours.  Form at
  <https://rebelsky.youcanbook.me>.  You can also email me about other
  times, but check my schedule first.
* Please grab today's lab manual from the mentors.
* The computer science department maintains a mailing list for assorted
  announcements (talks, discussions, study breaks, internship opportunities,
  etc.).  Please drop me an email message if you'd like to be added.  
* There still seem to be some students in the afternoon section of CSC 151
  who would have better schedules if they could take the morning section.
  If you'd be willing to trade to the afternoon section, please let
  me know.
* Our students want you to know that some Grinnellians are going to
  Global Hack V the weekend of Sept. 11-13 in St. Louis.  Free 
  registration for Grinnell students!  Further information ont he
  Web site at <http://globalhack.org/> and from
  [kyaruzia17] and [kittaneh17].

### Scattered Notes on HW1

* Apologies to the first few people whose HW1 I graded.  I spaced on my
  grading scheme, and used check/plus/minus rather than vg/good/fair/poor.
* Please follow the instructions for the form and title of the HW1
  submissions.
* I've started a [list of lessons](../handouts/lessons.html) that
  students have provided in their introductory surveys.

### Scattered Notes on Today's Lab

* We'll be doing the lab at the end of class.  When you finish the lab,
  you can leave.
* When we do today's lab, we will probably move some students into the
  neighboring room so everyone can have his, her, or zir own computer.
* We had some significant upgrades to our computer systems this summer.
  I've done my best to update the lab to incorporate those changes, but
  I probably missed something.  

### Upcoming Work

* Lots of short readings for Tuesday:
  [Parts of Algorithms](../readings/algorithms-reading.html) (review),
  [The DrRacket Program-Development Environment](../readings/drracket-reading.html),
  [Beginning Scheme](../readings/beginning-scheme-reading.html), and
  [How Scheme Evaluates Expressions (Take 1)](../readings/scheme-eval-1.html).
* HW2 to be distributed on Wednesday.

### Extra Credit Opportunities

* Preferred title: "CSC 151 Extra Credit (Your Name)"

#### Academic

* Tuesday, noon, CS Table, JRC 224C.  How Google Can Manipulate 
  Elections.  Readings available in the back of the classroom.

#### Peer Support

* Pals of PALS, pals@grinnell.edu, normally Saturday at 1:30
  and Mondays at 4:45.  Requires sign up in advance.
* Pun Club, Saturdays, 4pm, Way over Younker

### Questions

* How do I learn about AppDev?  Email [kyaruzia17] 

Lessons from day one [15 min]
-----------------------------

How could we have gotten groups together more efficiently?

* Assign positions in the room based on number
* Organize by another characteristic

What were some things you might have taken away from Friday's
demonstration (hopefully, things that will help you as you write
your own algorithms)?

* Be specific - word choice - don't assume much - don't assume that
  context is understood because computers are literal.
* Don't over-complicate things
* Sometimes there are more efficient ways to accomplish a task than
  you could ever envision.
* Consider possible problems in your algorithm and make sure to
  accommodate them.
    * Unspecific language
    * Different inputs than you expect.
* Have a backup plan!
* Consider all possible outcomes
* Describe important things in the beginning.  "I will use 'dominant
  hand' to name your left hand."
* Trial and error is part of the process, but don't try the same thing
  again and again.
* Try smaller parts of the problem first.
* Have someone else read over your work to catch potential issues.
* Work in groups - shared ideas are often better.
* When things go wrong (and they will), it's funny

Common parts of an algorithm [10 min]
-------------------------------------

* What questions do we have about the reading on algorithms?
* Where did we see each algorithm part in the (potential) nut butter and
  preserve algorithm?
* What questions might Sam ask us, and can we answer them?

Getting started with Linux [20 min]
-----------------------------------
