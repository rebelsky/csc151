    * Admin.
    * Homework.
    * Questions.
* Lessons from day one.
* Common parts of an algorithm.
* About the course.
* Getting started with Linux. [1:40-2:05]

Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Sam forgot the attendance sheet.  We'll do attendance again on Wednesday.
    * Handing out accounts is a form of attendance.  Not here: BT
* Mr. Stone will be visiting class to bring your account information.
    * Separate from the rest of campus
    * So you get a new password
    * Mr. Stone wrote one for you
    * You should change it
    * If you had one already, you don't get one
    * If you don't remember, go to Mr. Stone's office
    * And you can watch him show me up on correct pronunciation of names
    * Mr. Stone is happy to talk to you about the software we have available,
      the wonders of open source, and the evils of the NSA
* When doing recitation, I will call on you in physical order in today's class.
* Welcome to our guest mentors, Toby B and Alex G 
* Extra credit: 
    * Thursday extra on summer research in CS, Thursday @ 4:30 in Noyce 3821.
    * CS Table Friday at noon in the Day PDR in the Marketplace: 3D Printing
      and Cyborg Pars

### Homework

* Don't forget that the first assignment is due at 10:30 p.m. tonight.
  I appreciate that assignments have started arriving.
* There are lots of readings for tomorrow's class, but they are all short.

### Questions

Are there questions on or from the homework?

_Can you correct your homework, as long as you submit it before the due date?_

> Certainly.  But the odds are about 20% that I'll grade the wrong assignment.

Are there questions from the readings (other than the ones that I plan
to ask you)?

Lessons from day one
--------------------

Review: Some things we commented about yesterday, and some followup
comments from SamR.

Summary of yesterday

* Cs is the study of algorithms, algorithms are instructions.
* Yesterday's exercise: Instructions to make nut butter and jelly.

Things we learned

* When writing instructions, know what your audience knows.
    * Part of learning to write algorithms is learning the basic set of
      instructions you can use.
* Be specific.  If your audience can misinterpret you, it will.
    * Computers are sentient and malicious.
* When things go wrong, it's funny, not painful (well, except for me).
    * Be positive!
* You write better algorithms if you can observe them working step by step.
    * We'll work in a development environment in which you can play with
      small instructions.
* You write better algorithms when you write them with other people.
    * And so we force you to do so
* Know your data - (Screw-top vs pop top).
    * We'll learn a new kind of information (e.g., number, string, picture)
      and the operations that we can use on that information
* Watch for infinite loops.
* Computers seem to intentionally misinterpret instructions.
* Keep instructions simple, if possible.
* Testing should be rigorous and thorough.

Common components of an algorithm
---------------------------------

You did a reading about this.

What are some parts of an algorithm?

* Subroutines - A named section of code, that you can use again and again
    * How to open a jar
        if it's a screw-top jar
           unscrew the top by grasping the bottom with your dominant hand,
             the top with your non-dominant hand, placing the top toward the
             ceiling, and rotating your non-dominant hand counter-clockwise
        otherwise, if it's a pop-top jar
          ...
        otherwise
          throw it against the wall and cross your fingers
* Variables - , names of things
* Similar: Parameters Inputs to subroutines
* Conditionals - If ... Might or might not do something.  (Make a choice.)
    * If you grabbed the knife incorrectly, switch ends
    * If the stay-fresh seal is on top, ...
* Repetition - It's repeating the same action again and again and again
    * "Turn non-dominant hand counter-clockwise until the lid comes off"
    * Be careful about doing repeating forever

About the course
----------------

* You probably learned a bit in the first assignment.
* You'll learn more over the first week.

Getting started with Linux
--------------------------

* Yay!  Learn how to use the bunsen burners and test tubes.
    * No, not really, but the same depth of learning.
    * These are the things that help you get the real work done.
* It's sad when a CS prof can't write good instructions, isn't it?
