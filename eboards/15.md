Exam Questions
--------------

Transforming images by transforming each pixel
----------------------------------------------

* (image-variant image function)
   Builds a new image by applying function to each pixel
* Subtle, strange, and potentially complicating
    * Traditionally, we write (function params)
    * When we write (image-variant kitten rgb-complement)

Sequencing transformations with compose
---------------------------------------

* If we want multiple tranformations, we can compose them
    (image-variant kitten (compose rgb-complement rgb-redder))

Anonymous transformations
-------------------------

* Can also use lambda outside of a define
   (image-variant kitten (lambda (color) (rgb-new 255 0 (rgb-blue color))))
* Why do this rather than
(define fred
  (lambda (color)
    (rgb-new 255 0 (rgb-blue color))))
(image-variant kitten fred)
