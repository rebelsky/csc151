### Questions

Introduction: What is CS?
-------------------------

* Use a language to tell a computer how to solve problems?
* Study of how computers function
    * We study in order to make things better?
* Writing programs?
* Science: A way of studying the world; a method of inquiry.  
    * We observe to understand how things work.  
    * We ask why.
    * We come up with hypotheses
    * We design experiments
    * We conduct experiments.
    * Analyze the results
    * And do it all over again
* Computer science is the study of algorithms and data representation
    * Algorithm - Fancy term for instructions
* Generally, we write our algoriths and representations for use on the
  computers
