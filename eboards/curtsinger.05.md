### Admin

* Your class is invited to the Thursday 10am review sessions.  Notes from
  those sessions get posted to my class's Web site and are available for
  all students.
* As you should have discovered already, we are introducing a *lot* of
  vocabulary (procedure names) in these first few days of class.  I do
  recommend that you find a way to keep track of that vocabulary.
* Before today's lab (and perhaps before every lab you do for the next
  week or so), please type the following command in the terminal window.
