Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* No attendance today (the quizzes suffice).
* Notes from the Thursday 10am review sessions get posted to the eboards, 
  provided *someone* shows up for the review sessions.
* As you should have discovered already, we are introducing a *lot* of
  vocabulary (procedure names) in these first few days of class.  I do
  recommend that you find a way to keep track of that vocabulary.
* Note: If I haven't responded to an email within 24 hours, I've probably
  lost it in my inbox.  Try resending (I will not take offense).
* Before today's lab (and perhaps before every lab you do for the next
  week or so), please type the following command in the terminal window.

        /home/rebelsky/bin/csc151-update

* Friday PSA.

### Upcoming Work

* One reading for Monday:
  [Transforming RGB Colors](../readings/transforming-rgb-early-reading.html)
* [Assignment 2](../assignments/assignment.02.html) due Tuesday at 10:30.  
  Your assignment partner is the person (or people) at the same computer
  as you.
    * I will take questions on the assignment at the start of class 
      today and Monday and Tuesday.
* Lab writeup (due before class Tuesday)
    * Preferably with your lab partner.
    * Email to <grader-151-01@cs.grinnell.edu> (not to me).
