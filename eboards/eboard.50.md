### Questions

_Although I am not allowed to call it Happy Exciting Liberal Learning
 week, because names have power, I have way too much work next week.
 Can I turn in my exam late?_

> Why not turn it in early?

> Yes, you may turn it in late.  Negotiate with me.  But you will not
  get it back by Friday.

_Which are the easiest problems on the exam?_

> I think problems 1 (tree-map) and 7 (analyze code) are the most
  straightforward. However, 7 is a bit time-consuming and 1 requires
  documentation.

_Which are the hardest problems on the exam?_

> I think the remaining problems are similar in difficulty, depending on
  what topics you have and have not mastered.  Problem 6 (next largest)
  has some subtleties.  Problem 2 (file utils) is likely to be long, since
  it has lots of subproblems.  Oh, the extra credit problem is likely to
  make your brain hurt.

_What happens if I don't regularly call `close-input-port` and 
 `close-output-port`?_

> Eventually, DrRacket will refuse to open files or save files, including
  your exam.

_What time on Monday is the exam due?_

> 10:30 p.m.

_When will we understand binary search well?_

> After tomorrow's class.

_When is the final?  I'm too lazy to look it up._

> Tuesday the 15th and 9am or 2pm.

_What is the final like?_

> A really evil quiz.  Four problems.  No computer.  One sheet of 
  hand-written notes, 8.5x11 inches, double-sided.  4 problems correct: A.
  3 problems correct: B.  2 problems correct: C.  1 problem correct: D.
  0 problems correct: F.  Scheduled for three hours.  Historical evidence
  suggests that most students spend less than 1.5 hours.

_What is the grade scale in this class?_

> 94-100 is an A.  90-93 is an A-.  87-89 is a B+.  You should be able
  to figure out the rest.

_Can we have review sessions next week, even though we have no quiz?
 And can those be reviews for the final?_

> Yes.

_Do we have to let you know when we want to take the exam?_

> No, but it would be nice.

_Will you write two exams?_

> Probably not.  We'll write three.

_What happens if I take multiple finals?_

> I'll use the lowest final grade to replace your lowest exam grade.
