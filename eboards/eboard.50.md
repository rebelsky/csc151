  use, even if you don't copy and paste.

### Upcoming Work

### Questions

Chen
----

* I know nothing about your process of working.
* So I'm interested in some big picture issues.
* For those of you who have seen the images, what are some characteristics
  that made you more interested in one image than another?  What made
  a good one?
    * Complexity, but in one place (also a relationship between part
      to whole)
    * Composition, does it keep your eye moving around the image,
      drawn into the image
    * Relationships of images in a series; Compositional variations
    * Color contrast - Light and dark, shifts and changes
    * Illusions of 3D, makes it "pop", sense of depth
    * Bluriness vs. strong definition (e.g., HS portraits)
       * Bluriness can also bug you
* Series variation
    * Composition
    * Color
* Are there a few that you would group or categorize as similar?  What
  categories would you have?
    * Representational
    * Maybe some based on color
    * Some gradient approaches
    * Grids or structures that push up to the front 
       * Not so much figure and ground
       * Note that some of these structures seem to continue off the 
         picture plane.
       * Contrast
       * Etc.

Individual Groups
-----------------

Group 1

* Lattice of shapes (from 4 to 10 sides)
* Some alteration of rotation of center points
* Variations of backgrounda
* What's attractive?
    * Transition of the colors
    * The way the perception of the colors changes
        * Perhaps some sense of depth
    * Some of the color schemes
    * Use of empty space in bottom-left hand corner
* Note: Sometimes a process gives you something cool for free
    * Other color popping in
    * Curbes vs. straight

Group 2

* Inspired by Japanese artist, painting pictures of tsunami
* What do they like about itself?
    * Colors: Natural or clearly unnatural
        * You can choose to try to be natural
        * You can also try to be much less natural
* Other issues
    * Sense of depth to the mountains
    * Use of the brush for the water looks cool
    * Opacity of the brush
        * Some concern that you can see the bottom of the mountain
    * Bifurcation of the horizon
    * Success at not looking computer generated

Group 3

* "We made dragon curves and put them in patterns that were interesting to
  us"
* So what was interesting to you?
    * Things connecting to each other
    * Diffferent ways of doing colors
* Separate of shapes in different ways
* What might make it more successful?
    * Other color choices?
    * Less Symmetrical?
    * Less centered
* Think about tiling the image
* What changes would you make?
    * Maybe put the darker colors at the center
    * Maybe different background colors

Group 4

* Lots of triangle meshes
* Four backgrounds
* Different color schemes for the same background
* Which do you like?
    * Metalic looking diamonds as background
    * But colors in the triangles which vary in colors
* What else is interesting?
   * The color gradient has an effect on how you see the lines
   * Switch of fore/back transitions over the diagram
   * Challenge of two cool elements that don't mix together all that
     well.

Group 5

* Very clear lines, with different centersa
* Show the number with circles
* Focused figure in the center
* Favorite: Red black and white
* Likes three dimensionality
* Sense of movement
* Almost like a filmstrip

Group 6

* Mostly monochromatic - range of colors
* How do the colors and the personality of shapes relate?
* Gothic and dramatic
* Needles in the middle make you feel a bit "antsy"
