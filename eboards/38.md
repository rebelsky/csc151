Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Exam 2 returned.  I've sent out an answer key.
* Reminder: I get so much email that sometimes I miss some, and often I
  file it automatically without reading it.  If you need me to read your
  email
    * Give it a clear title that indicates that I should read it.  "Homework"
      and "Exam" suggest to me that you are submitting work.
    * Remind me if I haven't responded in a day or two.
    * And remind me again if I still haven't responded.

Quick notes on `image-compute!`
-------------------------------

Form

    (image-compute (lambda (x y) *formula-to-compute-color*) *width* *height*)

Simple color blend

    (image-compute (lambda (x y) (rgb-new x 0 x)) 255 255)

Colors are numbers.  Who needs to be sensible?

    (image-compute (lambda (x y) (+ (* x x x) (* 3 y x y))) 255 255)

How are RGB numbers computed?  Something similar to

    (+ (* 256 256 red) (* 256 green) blue)

Lab

* Some things appear to be broken.  Bleh.
