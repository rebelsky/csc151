Why have local procedures
-------------------------

* Sometimes we write a procedure, and it needs helpers.
    * If no one else needs those helper procedures, we shouldn't need to
      document them
    * More importantly, we shouldn't make them available to otehrs, because
      they will confuse people
* One strategy: let or let*
* Problem: Won't work for recursive procedures
* letrec
