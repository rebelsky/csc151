### Questions

_Does the order in which you scale and shift matter?

> Yes!  If you scale first, it remains centered at (0,0).  Shifting is then
  the expected amount.j  However, if we shift first, scaling scales not only
  the drawing, but the offset of the drawing.

_Does every group member have to do their own prologue and epilogue?_

> Yes.
