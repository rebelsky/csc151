=============================================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries.
    * Admin.
    * Questions.
* Random art.
* Why use randomness.
* The `random` procedure.
* Simulation.
* Lab.

Preliminaries
-------------

### Upcoming Work

* No reading for Friday.  Friday will be a chance to work on projects and
  ask questions and such.
* Homework for next Tuesday: Projects.
* Lab writeup: 3b and 6c.

### Admin

* Pictures due
    * Important moral: Don't save as .xcf.  Use .jpg or .gif.
* Congrats to TZ for his election to PBK.
* Thanks for patience with computer and alternate class format yeserday.
* Mentor sessions Thurday night at 7pm 
* There was a mixup on the due date of the third exam.  It is due
  Tuesday night of week 13.  The compensation is that you don't have work
  due in week 14.  (You still have to show up and learn stuff, and
  we might have a quiz, but you won't have an assignment due.)
* Friday's quiz will be on the obvious stuff (vectors, analysis, hop, and
  randomness)
    * We'll try not to put everything on the same problem.

### Extra Credit

* CS extra Thursday: Charlie Eddy on his project.
* CS pub night Thurday at 8pm in Lyle's pub.
* Get and wear one of the "1 in 4" shirts next week.  Pick up shirt Tuesday
  through Thursday, wear on Friday.
* Any other Sexual Assualt Awareness Week activity.
* Iowater project April 19 - Tag drains.  Mail [iowater] for details.

### Questions

Random art
----------

* Dada - Mess with art is.  Poking fun.
* Duchamp's Fountain - "I am an artist, what I make is art."
* A reaction to a loss of control by giving up control.
* How do you give up control when you are writing really careful instructions?
* Need a "unpredictable behavior" function.

Why use randomness
------------------

* Most frequently in simulation.
* We settle for an algorithm that seems to be random - meets the statistical
  properties, even though generated algorithmically.

The `random` procedure
----------------------

* (random 10) -> a number between 0 and 9

Simulation
----------

* Lab writeup: 3b and 6c.
