### Questions

_How do you check if your prologue is submitted properly?_

> Ask Sam.

> Generally, you should write your prologue in a separate document and
  then copy and paste.

> Make a bad joke and see if I respond.

_What are the hardest (most time consuming) problems?_

> 3 and 6.  5 is either easy or impossible.  Think about them all early
so that you can reflect on them while dancing at Blackout.

_Can I make random numbers that are negative?_

> Yes.  Do the reading and lab.  Then ask me.
