_Admin_

* New lab partners!  Please sit with your new lab partner.
    * I'm moving to switching once per week.
    * After fall break, I may let you choose partners (but may require
      that you switch once per week).
* You will have a substitute teacher (Mr. Walker) and mentors (Ms. Ryan and
  maybe Mr. Wheeler) on Wednesday and Friday.
* Work for Tuesday: 
    * Work on the homework assignment
    * Read Iteration
    * Do Lab writeup 8: Extra 2 and an Exploration
        * Try to get it in for Tuesday.
        * Due before class on Wednesday.  
        * Title: "CSC 151.02 Lab Writeup 8: Turtle Graphics (*NAMES*)".
    * Email me one additional suggestion for something you should or
      should not do when you're stuck on the exam.
* EC Opportunities:
    * CS Extras Thursday @ 4:30: Three Students on Student Sysadmin Work
    * CS Table Friday (Coding the Law)
    * More ...?
* Other things you might do (no EC, but possibly a good idea)
    * Poweshiek CARES March Thursday, Oct. 3.  Meet at Drake Library at 5 p.m.
    * GHS Homecoming Parade Thursday, Oct. 3.  If you've never seen a 
      small-town homecoming parade, it's worth it.  

HW Questions
------------

* If your images take a really long time to make, please submit them along with
  your code.
* When creating new rgb colors, you may need inexact->exact
    * Not
       (rgb-new (average ....) (average ....) (average ...))
    * But
       (rgb-new (inexact->exact (round (average ...)))

Problem Solving on Exams
------------------------

_What should you do when you're stuck on the exam?_

* Make a list of 3 "Do"s or "Don't"s.
* Share with a group of four.

Some outcomes:

* "Sam writes long, dense, text.  Make sure that you understand what the question
  is asking before staring."
* Think about it conceptually before you code.
* "Be nice to your future self" - Start early, ask questions, take notes to yourself.
* Problems can often be broken up into smaler parts, so do so when possible.
    * And try to keep it organized.
* When writing procedures that make pictures, sketch the pictures.
* Save early and often, DrRacket crashes. 
* Start early, your subconscious is sometimes a better problem solver than 
  your conscious mind.
* If you haven't made good progress in FIFTEEN MINUTES, move on to another problem.
* Take breaks.  Do a little bit at a time, not all at once.
* Explain it to a houseplant
* Use resources:
    * Electronic: Readings, Labs
    * Physical: Sam (about exam and anything else), Mentors/Tutors (about readings and labs)
* Test your code!

* Email me one more recommendation for your past self.
