Introduction
------------

Welcome to one of the Fall 2014 sections of Grinnell College's CSC
151, *Functional Problem Solving*, which is described relatively briefly
in the official [blurb](../handouts/blurb.html).  My own take on this
course is that we'll be starting to develop your knowledge of computer
science and *algorithmic problem solving*.  We will be using Scheme as
our development language, which gives us the abililty to use functional
approaches (as well as imperative and object-oriented approaches).
As in all Grinnell classes, we'll also be working on general skills,
from group work to thinking on your feet.

Starting about seven years ago, we developed a new approach to CSC151.
In both sections of the course, we will be emphasizing *media computation*
- the application of algorithmic problem solving techniques to media.
We will particularly emphasize algorithms for creating and manipulating
images.

*CSC 151 requires no prior knowledge of computer science or computer
programming*.  We'll teach you everything we want you to know.  It's okay
if you have some experience (although at times it may put you at a
disadvantage - we do things differently), but it's clearly not necessary.

In an attempt to provide up-to-date information, and to spare a few
trees, I am making this as much of a "paperless" course as I can.  Hence,
materials will be in a course web.  If you are puzzled by the organization
of the Course Web, browse a bit and then ask me.  If you find that you
want paper copies of pages, please read the notes on printing copies.
If you find that you are regularly printing pages, let me know and I
can provide them for you.

Important Warnings
------------------

*Warning!*  Experience shows that CSC151 exercises different parts of
your brain than other courses, even than math courses.  In general,
such exercise is a good thing - one of the key points of a liberal arts
education is that it exercises different parts of your brain.  However,
it may take a bit of time to get these new parts of your brain into shape.
Expect a few difficult times, but have confidence that you can get through
them and that you'll come out of the course with much more knowledge.

*Warning!*  Computers are sentient, stupid, and malicious.  When things
go wrong, don't blame yourself.  Ask me, a tutor, or the class mentor
for help.

*Warning!*  We are using some cutting-edge software, which means that
things will occasionally crash for no good reason.

Basics
------

*Meets*: MTWF 10:00-10:50, Science 3813.
Optionnl review sessions with SamR, Thursdays, 10:00-10;50, Science 3813.
Optional review sessions hosted by the class mentors TBD.

*Instructor*: 
[Samuel A. Rebelsky](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/)
[[rebelsky](mailto:rebelsky@grinnell.edu)],
Science 3824.  641-269-4410 (office).  641-990-2947 (cell).  
Office hours:  MThF 1:45-3:15.  I have "walking hours" MThF 1:15-1:45 (you can
sign up to walk with me and chat while we walk).
I also tend to follow an open door policy: Feel
free to stop by when my door is open or to make an appointment for
another time.

*Class Mentors*: 
Alex Greenberg '16 and Evan Bruns '16.  Mentor sessions Wednesday at
8:00 p.m. and Thursday at 8:00 p.m.

*Grading* (subject to change):

* Class participation: 10%;
* Regular homework: 10%;
* Lab writeups: 10%
* Project: 10%;
* Quizzes: 10%;
* Exams (4 graded exams plus optional final): 44%;
* Best of individual work (quizzes, average exam, final): 6%.

The final examination for this course is *optional*.
It can be used as a makeup for one examination.  I will count the
final examination only if it is higher than your lowest examination, and
it will replace the grade for that examination.  Our final examination
is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on Friday, Dec. 19.  However, since my other
course has a final at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, December 16, I can also offer
the final then.  (If neither time works for you, let's talk.  I'll find
another time.)

I will drop the grade on one quiz (the quiz with the lowest grade).

More information on grading can be found in the
[grading policies](../handouts/grading.html) page.

*Labs*: 
Computer science 151 is taught in a *collaborative workshop style*.
Each day, you'll work on laboratory problems with other students in
the class.  We may also start or end each class session with a short
lecture/discussion or a clicker activity.  Some labs will require short
writeups, which you will do with your lab partner.

*Extra Credit*:
I will often offer one unit of extra credit for attending a specified
academic event (e.g., a computer science talk or College convocation)
or for supporting your classmates in their public endeavors (e.g.,
attending a concert, dance recital, or sporting event).  Each category
is capped at four units of extra credit, which count as one point
toward your final grade.  So, if you attend four academic events and
four peer support events, you will receive an additional two points
toward your final grade.  For any activity you wish to credit this way,
you must send me a short (one paragraph) note about the activity within
two days of the activity.

*Tutoring*:
The CS Lab makes tutors for 151 available at regularly scheduled times.
As soon as tutors have been scheduled, I'll let you know what those times
are (and post them on this page).

*Good-Faith Grade Guarantee*: 
Because I realize that computer science does not "click" with all
students, I reward effort as well as outcome.  Hence, students who make
a "good faith" effort in this class will pass the class, with at least
a C+.   A good-faith effort includes missing no more than two classes,
turning in every homework assignment and at least 95% of the laboratory
writeups, and spending the requisite time on each examination.

*Class Software*:
For this course, we will be using [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org) and
[The GNU Image Manipulation Program](http://www.gimp.org), along with
some locally written extensions.  It will be hard to run the software
outside of the Computer Science department's network (or the Math/Stats
department's network).  We recommend that you work in our labs for the
ability to get help.  Since some students have reasons to work away
from our lab, we also provide a virtual machine that you can run on
most computers.

*Printing Pages*:
Most of the pages in the course web are designed for viewing onscreen.
If you do decide to print, you should consider printing the document
double-sided and two-up (that is, two pages side-by-side on one
physical page) so as to conserve paper.  When I distribute documents,
I will do my best to distribute them in this form.
