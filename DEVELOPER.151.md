Developer Notes for CSC151
==========================

Use a Developer Site
--------------------

I've tended to do all the changes in the live site.  I should probably
have a separate developer site that I use.  (That would also ensure that
I push more regularly.)

Tasks
-----

[ ] Update admin/report to follow the current grading scheme.
[ ] Update admin/sendreport to use the current semester.
[ ] Update eboards/.course to use current course.
[ ] Update admin/sendallreports and admin/makeallreports
