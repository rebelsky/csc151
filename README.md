rebelsky/generic-course
=======================
A github repository that will eventually hold the Web sites for all of
my courses (starting in Fall 2013).  The repository also serves as a
type of sandbox for me learning a bit more about git (particularly ways
to manage forks and branches).  Others should feel free to use whatever
they find (see LICENSE.md).
