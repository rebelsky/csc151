Notes from the Introductory Survey
==================================

What are two important things you learned in this part of the assignment?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Learning CS is a lot like learning a new language.
* This class is rather demanding. I should spend at least 8 to 10 hours 
  a week outside class. 
* This class also emphasizes on teamwork. Though I prefer to work alone, 
  I will try my best to work with my classmates as much as possible.
* The fact that I can eat small snacks during class as long as I keep 
  them away from the computers is a huge bonus (food is important for 
  human survival, so I guess that counts as important).
* I am a relatively slow and inefficient reader when it comes to 
  academic readings, so I’m excited to try the SQ3R method and see 
  if it helps me.
* I found the part about subject lines on emails really important. It is not 
  my first instinct to virtually shout at my professors using capital letters 
  and I probably would have done exactly what you do not want. 
* I also found it important that you were specific about how computer science 
  is a different way of thinking. 
* I learned that the Computer Science department has tutoring from 7-10 PM 
  Sundays-Thursdays and from 3-5 pm on Sundays.
* I also learned that you will drop the lowest quiz grade (thank you!!) 
  and that the final is optional and only counts if it is higher than  
  my lowest exam grade. 

What are two important things you learned in the first day of class?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* I learned a lot of peoples' names (which is always important).
* Computer programming is going to be just as hard as telling Sam how 
  to make a sandwich.
* A definition of computer science. Surprisingly “computer” did not even 
  appear in the definition Sam gave us. The important thing is algorithm, 
  and computer is like a medium because it is very good at doing tedious 
  computations. 
* The instructions given to the computer must be very precise. [x2]
* I learned to keep a safe distance when Sam is trying to make a point.
* You can get extra credit for attending peer's events.  Getting extra credit 
  not only helps the students become more close and supportive of each
  other, but also gives a boost for students who otherwise may be a bit
  more shy or don’t normally attend events. This allows them to have
  new experiences and become more part of the Grinnell community.
* I learned that you have a sense of humor with the almond butter and 
  jelly exercise
* I also learned that when you're explaining something to someone you 
  have to be as specific and thoughtful as possible because something
  that seems obvious and habitual to you may be totally unknown to
  someone else.
* Do not be discouraged by failed attempts and be willing to work out 
  the kinks.
