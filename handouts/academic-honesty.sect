<section id="academic-honesty"><title>Academic Honesty</title>

<para>
  <emphasis>This document describes my general approach to academic honesty. I
  may modify it for individual courses to better fit the structure and style
  of those courses.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
  An important characteristic of the academic endeavor is the notion
  that academics (students, faculty, researchers, staff) must follow high
  standards of honesty in their academic work.  One component of academic
  honesty is that academics must clearly indicate which work (ideas,
  writing, etc.) is theirs and which belongs to others.
</para>

<para>
  Grinnell's student handbook has included the following statement:
</para>

<blockquote>
<para>
  When you study at the College, you join a conversation among scholars,
  professors, and students, one that helps sustain both the intellectual
  community here and the larger world of thinkers, researchers, and
  writers. The tests you take, the research you do, the writing you
  submit - all these are ways you participate in this conversation.
</para>

<para>
  The College presumes that your work for any course is your own
  contribution to that scholarly conversation, and it expects you to
  take responsibility for that contribution.  That is, you should
  acknowledge what is your own individual work and what you have derived
  from others so that other members of the community can trace the
  evolution of your ideas.  
</para>

<para>
  However, there is much more to academic honesty than just making sure to
  cite work you've used.  In particular, you are expected to provide a true
  and accurate representation of your work in experimental endeavors (e.g.,
  it is academically dishonest to invent or modify experimental results).
  It is also academically dishonest to aid another in an academically
  dishonest act (e.g., to provide aid on a no-aid exam, to write a paper
  for another student).
</para>

<para>
  Why do we care so much about academic honesty?  As the Student Handbook
  suggests, the advancement of knowledge requires that a trail of ideas
  be available so that successes and failures can be traced backward.
  More importantly, your own personal integrity should require you to
  be academically honest.
</para>

<para>
  In Fall 2000, I had my first serious encounters with academic dishonesty
  at Grinnell. Since that time, I have tried to be careful in spelling
  out what I expect from my students.  What follows are some general
  expectations.
</para>

<para>
  I expect you to follow the highest principles of academic honesty.
  Among other things, this means that any work you turn in should be your
  own or should have the work of others clearly documented.  However, when
  you explicitly work as part of a group or team, you need not identify
  the work of each individual (unless I specify otherwise).
</para>

<para>
  You should never <quote>give away</quote> answers to homework assignments
  or examinations.  You may, however, work together in developing an
  approach for most homework assignments - design, general algorithms,
  etc.  Except as specified on individual assignments, each student
  should develop his or her own final version of the assignment.  On most
  written assignments, each student should write up an individual version
  of the assignment and cite the discussion.  On non-group programming
  assignments, each student should do his or her own programming,
  although students may help each other with design and debugging.
  If someone else (e.g., a classmate or class mentor) helps you on an
  assignment, please include a note in the assignment that indicates
  that you received such help and summarizes the help you received.
</para>

<para>
  When working on examinations, you generally should not use people
  (other than me) as resources.  In most cases, I will allow you to look
  up things on the Web, but you should read the examination guidlines
  to be sure.  In most examinations, I will not allow you to ask tutors
  and mentors anything pertaining to the exam, not even general syntax
  questions.  If you need help, you'll need to talk to me or a colleague.
</para>

<para>
  If you have a question as to whether a particular action may violate
  academic standards, please discuss it with me (preferably before you
  undertake that action).
</para>

<section id="collaborative-work"><title>Collaborative Work</title>

<para>
  Most of my teaching involves <emphasis>collaborative work</emphasis>.
  I believe (and have found) that students learn better when they
  can consult with each other.  There are few better ways to learn
  something than to explain that thing to someone else.  In computer
  science, collaboration is particularly important because you often
  encounter small problems that a second set of eyes can easily identify
  and fix and because <quote>real world</quote> computer science is
  almost always a collaborative activity.  For example, <emphasis>pair
  programming</emphasis> is a key aspect of many forms of the software
  design methodology known as agile programming.
</para>

<para>
  In each assignment I give, I do my best to make it clear whether
  the assignment is intended to be a group assignment or an individual
  assignment. When it's an individual assignment, I do my best to indicate
  whether parts of the assignment can be approached collaboratively.
  If you're not sure, ask.
</para>

<para>
  For most of my courses, almost all non-exam work will permit
  collaboration.  That is, if I don't specify otherwise on an individual
  assignment, you may assume that you can talk about design together,
  should code individually, and can help each other look for bugs (in
  design, code, implementation, whateer).
</para>

</section>  <!-- collaborative-work -->

<section id="kinds-of-work"><title>Categories of Work</title>

<para>
  In my classes, I assign a variety of types of work.  Different categories
  have different expectations.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis>Laboratories</emphasis> are almost always collaborative.
  You should generally plan to work on laboratories with at least one
  other student.  When you're stuck on a problem, you should feel free to
  ask for help from almost anyone (me, the class mentor, another student,
  a TC, a friend, etc.), but include a note that you received such help.
  If I ask you to write up a laboratory, you and your partner or partners
  should do only one writeup.  You should not copy text from another
  group's writeup.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis>Homework assignments</emphasis> may be individual or group
  assignments.  For either kind, you should feel free to ask for help from
  almost anyone (me, the class mentor, another student, a TC, a friend).
  If I give an individual homework, I expect each individual to write
  up his or her answers individually (no copying!).  However, you may
  certainly ask a colleague to proofread or comment on your answers,
  provided you cite that person.  If I give collaborative homework,
  each group of students should write and turn in its own single set
  of answers.  However, you can still ask colleagues in other groups
  to proofread or comment on your answers.  (Once again, you should
  cite them.)
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis>Take-home examinations</emphasis> are always individual work.
  You may refer to any written materials (e.g., textbooks, Web pages,
  your personal notes) that you wish.  However, you may not talk to
  anyone (except me or other faculty teaching the same course) about
  the examination or related issues.  I'm very strict about this issue;
  I want you to avoid <emphasis>all</emphasis> discussion about the exam,
  not just questions about the material on the exam.  You certainly can't
  ask someone how to do a problem.  But you can't ask about other things,
  either.  For example, you may not even ask a tutor or mentor how to use
  the programming language for the exam.  Similarly, you may not ask a
  colleague how much they've done on the exam or whether they've finished
  a problem (and you can't brag about finishing a problem either).
  At times, I may give you permission to talk to the course mentor about
  an exam, but please make sure that you have explicit permission.
</para>

<para>
  <emphasis>In-class quizzes and examinations</emphasis> are also always
  individual work.  You may not talk during class or discuss the exam with
  anyone in class.  You may ask me questions.  My in-class examinations
  are typically closed-book and closed computer.  However, I typically
  allow students to bring one sheet (8.5 x 11 inches) of hand-written
  notes to the exam.
</para>

</section>  <!-- kinds-of-work -->

<section id="citing-code"><title>Citing Program Code</title>

<para>
  Note that computer programming shares with normal writing a need to
  cite work taken from elsewhere.  It is certainly acceptable practice
  to borrow other code for your assignments.  However, you must cite any
  code that you use from elsewhere, including your own code.  You are
  also responsible for the quality of code you submit and there's a lot
  of mediocre code on the Web.
</para>

<para>
  Each piece of code you take from elsewhere must include a comment 
  that specifies:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    the author of the original code;
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    the date the original code was written and the version of the
    code (if available);
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    the date you incorporated the code into your program;
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    a summary of the modifications (if any) you made to the code; and
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    instructions for getting the original code (e.g., a URL).
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  These guidelines apply not only to the code you get from the Web and
  elsewhere; they also apply to code you get from me and from the textbook.
</para>

<para>
  You need not cite the libraries you use, as the command to include
  libraries within a program provides sufficient citation.
</para>

</section> <!-- citing-code -->

<section id="citing-web-pages"><title>Citing Web Pages</title>

<para>
  The advances of the Internet and the World Wide Web have led to
  challenges in citation.  Some seem to believe that it is acceptable
  for a citation to consist of a URL.  However, a citation should
  provide much more information.  Consider what a typical citation to
  the printed literature contains: Author, Date, Publisher, Title of
  Article, Publisher, etc.  Your Web citations should contain at least as
  much detail.  That is, you must include not just the URL, but also the
  author of the page (using <quote>Anonymous</quote> or an institutional
  author, if necessary), the title of the page, the publisher (the site),
  and the date.
</para>

<para>
  The date is particularly important.  Unlike printed sources, which
  have new editions when they change, electronic resources often change
  unexpectedly.  By including the date the page was accessed and modified,
  you at least provide some indication of when the ideas you were using
  were available at the specified location.
</para>

<para>
  Here is a sample citation for my academic honesty policy, using a slight
  variant of the APA format.
</para>

<section id="sample-takehome-policies"><title>Sample Take-Home Examination Policies</title>

<para>
  <emphasis>These are my typical policies for take-home examinations.
  They are included to give you a sense as to what I expect.</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
  This examination is open book, open notes, open mind, open computer,
  open Web. However, it is closed person. That means you should not talk to
  other people about the exam. Other than as restricted by that limitation,
  you should feel free to use all reasonable resources available to you.
</para>

<para>
  As always, you are expected to turn in your own work. If you find ideas
  in a book or on the Web, be sure to cite them appropriately. If you use
  code that you wrote for a previous lab or homework, cite that lab or
  homework and the other members of your group. If you use code that you
  found on the course Web site, be sure to cite that code. You need not
  cite the code provided in the body of the examination.
</para>

<para>
  Although you may use the Web for this exam, you may not post your
  answers to this examination on the Web. And, in case it's not clear,
  you may not ask others (in person, via email, via IM, by posting a
  <quote>please help</quote> message, or in any other way) to put answers
  on the Web.
</para>

<para>
  Because different students may be taking the exam at different times,
  you are not permitted to discuss the exam with anyone until after I have
  returned it. If you must say something about the exam, you are allowed
  to say <quote>This is among the hardest exams I have ever taken. If
  you don't start it early, you will have no chance of finishing the
  exam.</quote> You may also summarize these policies. You may not tell
  other students which problems you've finished. You may not tell other
  students how long you've spent on the exam.
</para>

<para>
  You must include both of the following statements on the cover sheet of
  the examination.
</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    I have neither received nor given inappropriate assistance on this
    examination.
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    I am not aware of any other students who have given or received
    inappropriate assistance on this examination.
  </listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
  Please sign and date each statement. Note that the statements must be
  true; if you are unable to sign either statement, please talk to me
  at your earliest convenience. You need not reveal the particulars of
  the dishonesty, simply that it happened. Note also that inappropriate
  assistance is assistance from (or to) anyone other than Professor Rebelsky
  (that's me).
