<section id="email"><title>Thoughts About Email and Encryption</title>

<para>
  Most of us, myself included, don't think much about email, other
  than that it's a convenient way to communicate.  But a few recent 
  events suggest that we should be a bit more thoughtful.  Hence,
  I encourage you to consider using mail encryption software,
  particularly the <ulink url="http://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy 
  Guard (GPG)</ulink>.

<para>
  Since I use GPG, I've written <ulink url="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/gpg.html">a really brief introduction</ulink>.
  There are a host of more useful and more comprehensive introductions to and tutorials about GPG, 
  so I'm not going to write much here, other than to recommend that
  you learn about using GPG.  I will say that, depending on what email
  package I'm using and who I'm communicating with, encryption is either
  trivial (one click and one password when I'm using Mail.app and sending
  email) or a slight pain (saving the encrypted message as a file and
  then running a decryption program when I'm receiving an encrypted
  message via Webmail).
</para>

<para>
  GPG is available for all three major operating systems (and probably
  for others, too).

    On the Mac, I use <ulink url="https://gpgtools.org/">GPGMail 2</ulink>.
    I find it simple and straightforward.

  <listitem>
    I don't use Microsoft Windows, but I hear that 
    <ulink url="http://www.gpg4win.org/">gpg4win</ulink>
    works pretty well.

    On the Linux workstations in the MathLAN, GPG is installed as
    a command line tool.

  If you send me your public (or a link to your public key) and ask me to
  encrypt email to do you, I will do my best to remember (although I may
  not always succeed).   You can find my public key at 
  <ulink url="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/rebelsky.gpg">http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/rebelsky.gpg</ulink> or at the MIT key server,
  <ulink url="http://pgp.mit.edu/">http://pgp.mit.edu/</ulink>.

<para>
  You may find it a bit strange that I'm giving you instructions for
  encrypting your email when I'm encouraging you to use a public IRC
  channel to discuss homework.  But the combination is intentional.  
  IRC channels are supposed to be public.  I ask you to use an IRC channel
  to remind you of the benefits of working in public.  In contrast, email
  is supposed to be private.  I teach you about GPG to help you ensure
  that your remail remains private.  You are free to judge the best
  balance between the two.
