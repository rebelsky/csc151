Some Advice on Examinations
===========================

Both Janet Davis and Sam Rebelsky asked their students <quote>What do
you do when you're stuck on the exam?</quote>  More generally, we asked
students to give general recommendations on how to do well on the kinds of
exams we seem to give.  of the strategies that the students came up with.

Do
--

* Save your work.  Often.  Something will crash.
* Be consistent in your coding style.
* Try writing something.
* Finish the labs.  And, even if you've finished the labs, you may find
  it useful to review them.
* Review related labs and readings.
* Test many cases.
* Understand your code.
* Step through your code carefully, _on paper_.
* Turn in all your work, including unfinished work.
* Break your code up into smaller pieces - Write "helper" procedures.
* Seek clarity from the instructor.
* Sometimes it's good to set aside what you've done and start again from
  scratch.  (But don't just delete or throw away the non-working code, save
  it as a reference.)
* Drink coffee.
* Look at the details.
* Read the problems and policies *thoroughly*
* Take time to think.
* Think about efficiency.
* Be positive.
* Ask "Is this the simplest way"
* Get stuff together and start early.
* Cite.
* Move on to other problems when you are stuck.
* Solve conceptually - draw a picture, write it in English.
* Do math on paper.
* Do an example.
* Laugh and have fun.
* The exams of have long, dense, text.  Make sure that you understand what 
  the question is asking before staring.  And if you don't understand, talk
  to your faculty.
* Think about it conceptually before you code.
* "Be nice to your future self" - Start early, ask questions, take notes 
  to yourself.
* Problems can often be broken up into smaler parts, so do so when possible.
    * And try to keep it organized.
* When writing procedures that make pictures, sketch the pictures.
* Start early, your subconscious is sometimes a better problem solver than
  your conscious mind.
* If you haven't made good progress in, say, fifteen minutes, move on 
  to another problem.
* Take breaks.  Do a little bit at a time, not all at once.
* Explain it to a houseplant.
* Use resources:
    * Electronic: Readings, Labs
    * Physical: Professor (about exam and anything else), Mentors/Tutors 
      (about readings and labs)
* Work in a computer lab where tutors are ready to help you.   
* Organize code into steps so it looks good. If it looks good it will 
  be easier to understand in the future for yourself and others. 
    * And yes, your faculty will be better at grading easy to read code.
* Follow the directions - There's probably a reason that the instructions
  specify certain procedure names or parameters.

Don't
-----

* Sit and stare
* Delete all your code
* Assume you are totally wrong
* Get sick.  (If you do, talk to your faculty.  We have been known to
  modify deadlines.)
* Obsess.
* Rush into a problem without thinking.
* Get frustrated.
* Beat your head against the wall.
