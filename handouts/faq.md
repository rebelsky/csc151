Frequently (and not-so-frequently) Asked Questions
==================================================

These are my attempts to answer some questions that students have asked
(in the first assignment, in office hours, via email, etc.)

Note that there may be some repetition on this page.

About the Course
----------------

_I see that the course is "Functional Problem Solving 'with lab'".  When
is the lab?_

> The lab is mixed in with the the regular course.  There is no separate
lab session.  However, you should know that this course meets four days
per week and you are expected to show up all four days.

_How difficult is the course?_

> That's a hard question to answer.  Computer science is a different
way of thinking.  Some folks find it natural.  Some folks find it nearly
impossible.  I see at least a factor of ten difference in time spent on
some assignments.  And I've found no good ways to predict how difficult
someone will find the course.  I'm not alone in this, faculty nationwide
observe the same tenfold difference.

> Of course, time spent is only one issue.  Often, the people who seem
to need to spend more time understand the material at least as well as
people who spend less time.

_How can I excel in the course?_

> Different students find different ways to excel.  In general, one 
excels in my courses by taking an active approach to the material -
read carefully, make lists of questions, ask questions in class, 
answer my questions, seek help when confused, discuss material with
colleagues, and so on and so forth.

> But I find students also excel when they engage enough with the
material that they find natural ways to exceed my expectations -
by finding new approaches, by doing creative things, by extending
ideas.

_Is the late policy the same for take-home exams as it is for assignments?_

> It's similar.  I expect exams in on time.  I expect you to start them
early.  But I understand that students get sick or that unexpected
things come up.  In all such cases, you have a responsibility to notify
me if you will not be able to get the work in on time.  I'll admit that
I don't recall a student ever turning an exam in late.

_Can I eat small snacks (e.g., carrots, muffins) during class?_

> Yes, provided you keep them far away from the computers.

_Is there a way to use a personal computer for the work in this course?_

> After the first week or two, we will provide you with a virtual computer 
for you to use with Virtual Box.

_I was just wondering what kind of out of class work we were going to
be doing.  I'm just a bit worried that completing work out of class will
be difficult if I can't make it to a computer lab._

> There are five regular kinds of work in CSC 151.

>  *Daily readings*.  You should do the readings before each class period.
We recommend that you do these with a computer at hand so that you can
try things as you go. (That's not strictly necessary; many students just
read and reflect.)  You should attempt the self-checks at the end of
each reading.

> *Daily labs*.  You will do these in class, working in pairs.  There's
sometimes followup work (usually less than thirty minutes worth).
Most students find time during the day to finish that up in the lab.

> *Weekly homework assignments and projects*.  You do those outside of class in small groups.  Since you're working in small groups, you are best off working in the lab.  We also have tutors available most evening to help with those.

> *Take-home exams*.  These take the place of some homework assignments.
You do these on your own.  You can use your own computer (with some
software we provide) or the lab computers (where the software is already
installed).

> *Weekly quizzes*.  Students study for these in a variety of ways,
mostly by making sure that they've understood the readings and done the
work on the daily labs.  So, they can be done with or without computers.

> So ... three kinds of work in the class assume you'll have access to a 
computer outside of class.  Two more benefit from it.

> I'll note that lots of CSC 151 students like working in our computer labs
(Science 3813 and 3815).  There's a good sense of community in those rooms.

_Please explain the units of extra credit._

> I give you one unit (1/4 point) per activity.  You can attend some
specified academic events.  You can attend some of your classmates'
activities.  I cap each category at four units.  So, if you attend
four events in two categories, you get two points of extra credit.
The points are on a 100-point scale.  For example, if you have an 88 at
the end of the semeseter and do all of the extra credit, you'll end up
with a 90, effectively moving your grade from a B+ to an A-.  I will
occasionally mark some extra credit as "Miscellaneous".  Such extra credit
can be used for either academic or peer support, whichever has the 
greater effect.

_Is there a location where we can see a list of what the extra credit
assignments are or if you will only tell us in class?_

> I will tell you each day in class.  Both my outline for the class and the eboard for the class are available online, and that's a good place to look.  The latest eboard is probably the best place to look.

> <http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CSC151/2015S/outlines/current.html>

> <http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CSC151/2015S/eboards.am/current.html>

_Are we going to be given due dates for each extra credit assignment, or are they due the night of the event?_

> I prefer to receive your response paragraph within two days of the event.
However, I have been known to be somewhat lax on that deadline.

_What's the typical grade spread in this course?_

> I do not report grade spreads.

_Are there any good online resources that you recommend that might
supplement my understanding of what I am learning in class?_

> The front door has a link to some general materials about Scheme
and Racket.  But our course is unique enough that the best resources
are probably people.

_I understand that there will be a lot of group work in the course,
which is fine. But how do you ensure that all students get hands-on
experience with the techniques?_

> I give you individual work as well as group work and I change your
partners a lot.  Your mentors and I will also remind people to take
turns at the keyboard.  I expect that the approaches help ensure that
everyone thinks about the material.

_The Web site spent a fair amount of time discussing how to cite and use internet sources correctly. how frequently do you expect students to seek help from the Internet?_

> Evidence suggests that students regularly seek help from the Internet.  
It's rarer in this course, but it's very common in my other courses.

_Why do we use Scheme and not a language more conventionally used in college intro classes (from what I've heard) like C++ or Java?_

Scheme is much simpler.  The definition is small: There are fewer words in the definition of Scheme (well, the previous definition of Scheme) than there are procedures in the Java libraries.  Scheme doesn't have a lot of syntactic rules.  Once you master parentheses, you've gotten most of the syntax.  But, most importantly, Scheme encourages you to think in ways that we think computer scientists should think.  Plus, Scheme is one of the few languages that we can use to write code I might call beautiful.

_I am wondering how the groups will work.  How will we get into groups and will they change?_

> I will assign you to groups, at least for the first few weeks of the
semester.  You'll get a partner (group of two) for every few labs and
a small group (usually three or four) for each homework assignment.  In
some cases, I will assign them randomly.  In others, I may use particular
criteria for doing group assignment.

About the Professor (i.e., About SamR)
--------------------------------------

_How did you get into computer science?_

> I entered college planning to be a math major (and I even graduated
college as a math major).  But I quickly learned that I would never be
a great math major.  More importantly, when I took my first computer
science class (in Lisp, if I recall correctly), I found that CS had
everything I liked about math (particularly problem solving) along with
the ability to construct things and to see your solutions "in action"
as it were.  I've never looked back.

> Over the past few years, I've started making art (mostly 
non-representational, sometimes with a performative aspect).  I find
making art and programming have many similarities, including the great
positive of making something new and interesting.

_Pick a category of objects and list five of your favorite objects in 
that category._

> Favorite ways to spend time.  1. Doing almost anything with my wife and
kids - just hanging, playing games, discussing some silly topic, whatever.
2. Reading (usually science fiction or nonfiction, but I have eclectic
tastes).  3. Coding (yeah, I code for fun).  4. Playing board games.  5.
Organizing things (books, CDs, whatever), even though you can't tell that
by looking at my office.

> I regret that "exercise" doesn't fall in that top 5.  I'm working on it.

_What are your favorite board games?_

> Mostly ones that few people have heard of (well, two of these board
gamers know, but not many other people): Cosmic Encounter. Yacht Race,
Carcasonne, and Circus Maximus.  But I play a lot of different games.
One current fave in the Rebelsky household is "Apples Against Humanity":
questions from Cards Against Humanity with answers from Apples to Apples.
(The answers in Cards Against Humanity are not suitable for children or,
well, anyone.)  My eldest would like us to play more Canasta.  I'd like
to play more Roborally, but there's rarely time.

_What is your favorite programming language? It may be easy to deny, but most people have a preference._

> Believe it or not, but it depends on the task.

> I really love programming in C.  It's efficient, it requires understanding of the machine, and it's concise.

> I love programming in Scheme about as much.  I don't think I've ever seen beautiful C code, but I can say that some Scheme code that one could really call beautiful.  (Okay, I think lots of map-reduce is beautiful.)  I play around a lot with the Mediascript code just for fun.

> But when I need a quick text manipulation program, I hack it out in Perl.
(However, the most recent text manipulation program I had to write, I wrote
in C.)

> I'm starting to find that I enjoy programming in Javascript, too, although
I need a better environment for doing so.  Javascript gives me many of the
things I like about Scheme (other than a nice syntax) with some additional
capabilities.

_Why did you become a computer science professor?_

> I started studying CS because I found it really compelling - I like 
making things and I like formal problem solving.  I became a professor
because I discovered I love seeing students learn and feeling like I
had a part in that learning.  I also seemed to some talent at teaching.

_What made you want to teach?_

> My mother was also a college professor.  (You can see her outstanding
psychology teacher of the year award inside my office door.)  Although
I was impressed by the effect she had on her students, I didn't think
I'd become a professor.  But in college and grad school, I learned that
I really liked teaching and seemed to be relatively good at it.  And
there are few feelings as good as seeing a student understand a complex
concept and knowing you had a role in that understanding.  Plus teaching
is a really interesting and complex challenge.

_What made you want to teach at Grinnell?_

> When I finished my Ph.D., I looked for places that cared about
teaching but that would let me continue research.  I ended up taking a
non-tenure-track job at Dartmouth for a few years, but really wanted to
be on the tenure track.  At the time I applied, I visited lots of places.
Grinnell was clearly the best fit - faculty who cared about teaching
and who were willing to innovate, students who were engaged.  And I
was clearly a good fit for Grinnell as I got an offer really quickly
after the visit.  It's been a great place to be - I continue to love the
students, value the colleagues, and find myself challenged and encouraged.

_Have you ever published any software?_

> It depends on how you define "published".  The CSC 151 software has been distributed to lots of people.  A Web service I wrote, oh, two decades ago, got used pretty heavily for about five years.  But almost everything I do is open source.
My latest software is published on the Web.

_What would you do differently if you could do college again?_

> Let's see.  1. I'd learn good work habits.  2. I'd work on my writing.  3. I'd do internships.  

> 1.  Work habits.  I was able to get reasonably good grades in college by relying on my intellect, not on hard work.  So when I got to grad school, I was screwed.  Developing good work habits earlier would have made the rest of my life better.  

> 2. Writing.  I did really well on writing when I was in high school (and even in a few college courses I took in HS).  But my writing was not great.  Not focused.  Too much passive voice.  Etc.  I took a writing course my first year of grad school and it made me a much better writer.  I wish I had done that earlier.

> 3. Internships.  I love what I do.  But I really never explored anything but academia.  I should have.

_What's the one food item you can't live without?_

I want to say chocolate, but I think "fruit" is probably the answer if
you'll accept that.  If I have not narrow, I think it's pears.  Of course,
to be literal, I think it's water (although water isn't food).

_What is your favorite section of computer Science?_

> My favorite courses to teach: CSC 151, because I like introducing students to the field. CSC 207, because I think it's where you really start to develop the tools of computer scientist and software designer. My one-credit "C & Unix" seminar, because I can make sure you learn things that are essential. (Whoops, that's three.)  Oh, I also like teaching tutorial.

About Assignments
-----------------

_On the first assignment, which asked me to synthesize information from the
course web, should I cite the course web?_

> The assignment clearly asks you to synthesize information on the
web site, and so one could argue that such citations are unnecessary.
Nonetheless, in an ideal world, you would provide a clear citation as
to where you found each piece of information.

About the Course Web
--------------------

_The daily eboards look much nicer than what you type in class.  How
do I see what you type in class?_

> Replace the `.html` at the end with `.md`.

_What technology do you use to build the course web?_

> I use two markup languages.  For many of the pages (e.g., readings,
labs) I use a form of XML called Docbook.  But Docbook is wordy, so
for other pages (e.g., the daily outlines and eboards), I use
Markdown.  I also have a bunch of scripts to help with all of this.
You can find the scripts and source code on github.

> If you want to see the "source code" for a Web page, try replacing
the `.html` with `.md` or `.sect`.  (You may have to try both, what
I use varies.)

_Just to be sure, how am I supposed to figure out when assignments are due?_

> You can remember that almost all assignments are due Tuesday at 
10:30 p.m.  (But not all of them.)  I'd recommend checking the
course schedule, which lists all of the kinds of assignments.  I
will also try to put major assignments on the Google calendar.

About Other Things
------------------

_What's a "TLA"_

> Three-Letter Acronym.  They appear a lot in computing (e.g., irc,
pgp, gpg) and in other situations (e.g., irs, ssn).  Too often, folks
use TLAs without explaining them, and so I say "What was that TLA?"
I also say that to myself, because I use TLAs a lot.  These days,
TLA may also stand for Grinnell's Center for Teaching, Learning, and
Assessment.

_What's the attachment that seems to accompany every email message you send?_

> A digital signature. See [http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/gpg.html](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/gpg.html).  Because Outlook365 doesn't like digital signatures, I don't use them as much as I used to.

_Do you prefer "freshman" or "first-year"?_

> The term "freshman" is gendered, and so the Grinnell Style Guide
suggests that we use "first-year" or "first-year student".  I prefer
"freshling", but it hasn't caught on.

_Why do you address us by last name, but expect us to address you by
first name?_

> I enjoy playing with notions of power and authority.  I'll probably
use both first and last names with my students.
