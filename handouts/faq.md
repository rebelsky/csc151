Frequently (and not-so-frequently) Asked Questions
==================================================

These are my attempts to answer some questions that students have asked
(in the first assignment, in office hours, via email, etc.)

Note that there may be some repetition on this page.

About the Course
----------------

_I see that the course is "Functional Problem Solving _with lab_".  When
is the lab?_

> The lab is mixed in with the the regular course.  There is no separate
lab session.  However, you should know that this course meets four days
per week and you are expected to show up all four days.

_How difficult is the course?_

> That's a hard question to answer.  Computer science is a different
way of thinking.  Some folks find it natural.  Some folks find it nearly
impossible.  I see at least a factor of ten difference in time spent on
some assignments.  And I've found no good ways to predict how difficult
someone will find the course.  I'm not alone in this, faculty nationwide
observe the same tenfold difference.

> Of course, time spent is only one issue.  Often, the people who seem
to need to spend more time understand the material at least as well as
people who spend less time.

_How can I excel in the course?_

> Different students find different ways to excel.  In general, one 
excels in my courses by taking an active approach to the material -
read carefully, make lists of questions, ask questions in class, 
answer my questions, seek help when confused, discuss material with
colleagues, and so on and so forth.

> But I find students also excel when they engage enough with the
material that they find natural ways to exceed my expectations -
by finding new approaches, by doing creative things, by extending
ideas.

_Is the late policy the same for take-home exams as it is for assignments?_

> It's similar.  I expect exams in on time.  I expect you to start them
early.  But I understand that students get sick or that unexpected
things come up.  In all such cases, you have a responsibility to notify
me if you will not be able to get the work in on time.  I'll admit that
I don't recall a student ever turning an exam in late.

_Can I eat small snacks (e.g., carrots, muffins) during class?_

> Yes, provided you keep them far away from the computers.

_Is there a way to use a personal computer for the work in this course?_

> After the first week or two, we will provide you with a virtual computer 
for you to use with Virtual Box.

_Please explain the two units of extra credit.

> I give you one unit (1/4 point) per activity.  You can attend some
specified academic events.  You can attend some of your classmates'
activities.  I cap each category at four activities.  So, if you attend
four events in two categories, you get two points of extra credit.
The points are on a 100-point scale.  For example, if you have an 88 at
the end of the semeseter and do all of the extra credit, you'll end up
with a 90, effectively moving your grade from a B+ to an A-.

_What's the typical grade spread in this course?_

> I do not report grade spreads.

_Are there any good online resources that you recommend that might
supplement my understanding of what I am learning in class?

> The front door has a link to some general materials about Scheme
and Racket.  But our course is unique enough that the best resources
are probably people.

About the Professor (i.e., About SamR)
--------------------------------------

_It looks like you're teaching five or six courses in spring 2014.  Is that
really true?

> In addition to three four-credit courses, I'm teaching two one-credit
courses and supervising an independent study.  I have over 100 students
this semester, and each of my four-credit courses has daily homework.
It's going to be a busy semester.

_How did you get into computer science?_

> I entered college planning to be a math major (and I even graduated
college as a math major).  But I quickly learned that I would never be
a great math major.  More importantly, when I took my first computer
science class (in Lisp, if I recall correctly), I found that CS had
everything I liked about math (particularly problem solving) along with
the ability to construct things and to see your solutions "in action"
as it were.  I've never looked back.

> Over the past few years, I've started making art (mostly 
non-representational, sometimes with a performative aspect).  I find
making art and programming have many similarities, including the great
positive of making something new and interesting.

_Pick a category of objects and list five of your favorite objects in 
that category._

> Favorite ways to spend time.  1. Doing almost anything with my wife and
kids - just hanging, playing games, discussing some silly topic, whatever.
2. Reading (usually science fiction or nonfiction, but I have eclectic
tastes).  3. Coding (yeah, I code for fun).  4. Playing board games.  5.
Organizing things (books, CDs, whatever), even though you can't tell that
by looking at my office.

> I regret that "exercise" doesn't fall in that top 5.  I'm working on it.

_What are your favorite board games?_

Mostly ones that few people have heard of (well, two of these board
gamers know, but not many other people): Cosmic Encounter. Yacht Race,
Carcasonne, Circus Maximus.  But I play a lot of different games.
The current fave in the Rebelsky household is "Apples Against Humanity":
questions from Cards Against Humanity with answers from Apples to Apples.
(The answers in Cards Against Humanity are not suitable for children or,
well, anyone.)  My eldest would like us to play more Canasta.  I'd like
to play more Roborally, but there's rarely time.

_What is your favorite programming language? It may be easy to deny, but most people have a preference._

> Believe it or not, but it depends on the task.

> I really love programming in C.  It's efficient, it requires understanding of the machine, and it's concise.

> I love programming in Scheme about as much.  I don't think I've ever seen beautiful C code, but I can say that some Scheme code that one could really call beautiful.  (Okay, I think lots of map-reduce is beautiful.)  I play around a lot with the Mediascript code just for fun.

> But when I need a quick text manipulation program, I hack it out in Perl.

_Why did you become a computer science professor?_

> I started studying CS because I found it really compelling - I like 
making things and I like formal problem solving.  I became a professor
because I discovered I love seeing students learn and feeling like I
had a part in that learning.  I also seemed to some talent at teaching.

_How did you become a computer science professor?_

> I got a Ph.D.  I taught while I was in graduate school to improve my
ability to teach.  When I nearlly finished my Ph.D., I applied for jobs.  
I started with a one-semester teaching job at Dartmouth that expanded into
four or so years.  Then I applied for more jobs, interviewed for jobs, and
found that Grinnell was my best match.  Fortunately, the folks at Grinnell
felt the same way, and so I came here.  I've been happy here ever since.

_What's the coolest thing you have ever created/programmed?_

> I built the software that lets Racket and GIMP communicate.  Before
that I'd build the software that we used to program the GIMP directly.
I'm pretty proud of that.  Using that software, I developed a fairly
cool suite of genetic art images.

> A colleage in art showed me this really awesome picture that someone 
drew with spiral line, where the thickness of the line varied and the
overall thing was a very detailed face.  I then wrote a program that
takes an arbitrary image and has our laser engraver do something similar.
(The program's not done yet, but I have some sample images.)  I haven't
described it well, but I'm really proud of it.

> And I've written some programs that create some cool 3D cubes using
the laser engraver and lucite.  (Can you tell that I like the laser
engraver?)

_What made you want to teach?_

> My mother was also a college professor.  (You can see her outstanding
psychology teacher of the year award inside my office door.)  Although
I was impressed by the effect she had on her students, I didn't think
I'd become a professor.  But in college and grad school, I learned that
I really liked teaching and seemed to be relatively good at it.  And
there are few feelings as good as seeing a student understand a complex
concept and knowing you had a role in that understanding.  Plus teaching
is a really interesting and complex challenge.

_What made you want to teach at Grinnell?_

> When I finished my Ph.D., I looked for places that cared about
teaching but that would let me continue research.  I ended up taking a
non-tenure-track job at Dartmouth for a few years, but really wanted to
be on the tenure track.  At the time I applied, I visited lots of places.
Grinnell was clearly the best fit - faculty who cared about teaching
and who were willing to innovate, students who were engaged.  And I
was clearly a good fit for Grinnell as I got an offer really quickly
after the visit.  It's been a great place to be - I continue to love the
students, value the colleagues, and find myself challenged and encouraged.

_Have you ever published any software?_

> It depends on how you define "published".  The CSC 151 software has been distributed to lots of people.  A Web service I wrote, oh, two decades ago, got used pretty heavily for about five years.  But almost everything I do is open source.

_What's your favorite dessert?_

> I really like the Chocolate Oblivion they serve at Relish.  It's a
flourless chocolate cake.  But there are times that berries are even 
better.

_How did you come to develop your unique method of teaching?  This is in reference to lesser focus on grades, more focus on sarcasm, learning and understanding the process rather than memorization._

> There are many factors that led to my teaching style, which I don't really think is unique.  I've never thought that memorization was the central goal of learning, so that's probably the fault of my elementary school teachers.  And I expect that most Grinnell faculty place memorization relatively low.  My emphasis on effort stems from an article a colleague showed me early in my time at Grinnell.  (I think the colleague was trying to say "Students expect their grades to be based on effort not results, but results are what matter."  I'm clearly contrary.)  I also know that I teach a subject that is different and intimidating, and so consider it important to make it more approachable.  I learned from my mother that different students show their skills differently, and so I try to give you a variety of ways to show your skills.

_What would you do differently if you could do college again?_

> Let's see.  1. I'd learn good work habits.  2. I'd work on my writing.  3. I'd do internships.  

> 1.  Work habits.  I was able to get reasonably good grades in college by relying on my intellect, not on hard work.  So when I got to grad school, I was screwed.  Developing good work habits earlier would have made the rest of my life better.  

> 2. Writing.  I did really well on writing when I was in high school (and even in a few college courses I took in HS).  But my writing was not great.  Not focused.  Too much passive.  Etc.  I took a writing course my first year of grad school and it made me a much better writer.  I wish I had done that earlier.

> 3. Internships.  I love what I do.  But I really never explored anything but academia.  I should have.

About Assignments
-----------------

_On the first assignment, which asked me to synthesize information from the
course web, should I cite the course web?_

> The assignment clearly asks you to synthesize information on the
web site, and so one could argue that such citations are unnecessary.
Nonetheless, in an ideal world, you would provide a clear citation as
to where you found each piece of information.

About the Site
--------------

_The daily eboards look much nicer than what you type in class.  How
do I see what you type in class?_

> Replace the `.html` at the end with `.md`.

_What technology do you use to build the course web?_

> I use two markup languages.  For many of the pages (e.g., readings,
labs) I use a form of XML called Docbook.  But Docbook is wordy, so
for other pages (e.g., the daily outlines and eboards), I use
Markdown.  I also have a bunch of scripts to help with all of this.
You can find the scripts and source code on github.

> If you want to see the "source code" for a Web page, try replacing
the `.html` with `.md` or `.sect`.  (You may have to try both, what
I use varies.)

_Just to be sure, how am I supposed to figure out when assignments are due?_

> You can remember that almost all assignments are due Tuesday at 
10:30 p.m.  (But not all of them.)  I'd recommend checking the
course schedule, which lists all of the kinds of assignments.  I
will also try to put major assignments on the Google calendar.

About Other Things
------------------

_What's a "TLA"_

> Three-Letter Acronym.  They appear a lot in computing (e.g., irc,
pgp, gpg) and in other situations (e.g., irs, ssn).  Too often, folks
use TLAs without explaining them, and so I say "What was that TLA?"
I also say that to myself, because I use TLAs a lot.

_What's the attachment that seems to accompany every email message you send?_

> A digital signature. See [http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/gpg.html](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/gpg.html)

_Do you prefer "freshman" or "first-year"?_

> The term "freshman" is genedered, and so the Grinnell Style Guide
suggests that we use "first-year" or "first-year student".  I prefer
"freshling", but it hasn't caught on.

_Why do you address us by last name, but expect us to address you by
first name?_

> I enjoy playing with notions of power and authority.  I'll probably
use both first and last names with my students.
