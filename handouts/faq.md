About the Site
--------------

The daily eboards look much nicer than what you type in class.  How
do I see what you type in class?

> _Replace the `.html` at the end with `.md`._

What technology do you use to build the course web?

> _I use two markup languages.  For many of the pages (e.g., readings,
> labs) I use a form of XML called Docbook.  But Docbook is wordy, so
> for other pages (e.g., the daily outlines and eboards), I use
> Markdown.  I also have a bunch of scripts to help with all of this.
> You can find the scripts and source code on github._
