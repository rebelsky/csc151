Lessons from the the course web
-------------------------------

* Seek help early!

* Assignments have "wrappers", which sound interesting.

* I can encrypt my email.

* Sleep is important to success.

* In this course, you are rewarded for effort, not just for getting
  a "right" answer. [x4]

* Extra credit is availble for attending talks and some other events.

* The final examination is optional.

* For this course, you must include two statements on the cover page of
  take-home exams: "I have neither received nor given inappropriate
  assistance on this examination."  "I am not aware of any other
  students who have given or received inappropriate assistance on this
  examination." [x2]

* For this course, you cite programing code by giving: the original 
  author, the date the original code was written, the date that you
  used the code, a summary of modifications you made, and how to find
  the original code. [x2]

* Sam may be gathering data on his students' learning.

* Cite class discussions.  Credit classmates.

* If you're spending less than 8-10 hours per week on this course, it may
  be that you're not doing enough.  If you're spending more than 8-10
  hours per week on the course, you're probably doing too much.  In both
  cases, you should talk to SamR.

* There are late work policies.

* Sam prefers plus/check/minus grading for homework.

* There are a wide variety of resources available for the course. [x2]

* The CS faculty have tried to design the course in a way that encourages
  success.

* We should do work in the CS labs, rather than on our own computers.

* I need to be creative and thorough in order to get an A.

* TLA stands for "Three-Letter Acronym".

* I learned the grading system Sam will use.

* Active participation in class discussions plays a role in learning. 
  Sam therefore expects you to participate. [x3]

* The class has a moderately large time committment.  (Sam thinks it's
  typical for Grinnell classes.)

* Time management is important.

* We'll be talking about a lot of different things.  (See the schedule
  for more details.)

* The class has many different kinds of work.

* I learned how to navigate the course web. [x2]

* Work should not just be correct, it should be exceptional.

* We will learn more than computer science in this course.  

* It's okay to be wrong in front of other people.

* SQ3R as an approach to reading.

Lessons from the first day of class
-----------------------------------

* The faculty member whose name is "Samuel A. Rebelsky" prefers to be
  addressed as "Sam" or "SamR", not "Professor Rebelsky".  He really
  does not like to be addressed in the generic. (Okay, the student
  first student who made this comment wrote "I learned to call you Sam.") [x3]

* It is important to think of a computer as a thing that will try its
  utmost best to locate and identify loopholes in your code.  For example,
  someone might interpret "side" as the side of the table, rather
  than along the edge of the top of the table.  So it is absolutely
  imperative to lay out specific, lucid statements with the greatest of
  precision and clarity.  (Sam phrases the first part of this response as
  "computers are sentient and malicious".) (Another student phrases this
  as "Don't freak out".) [x11]

* Working with partners aids in the learning process.

* We will be expected to work in groups. 

* Laugh at SamR's jokes.

* Have patience.

* Computer science is the study of algorithms.

* We write algorithms in English, computer languages, hardware, and more.

* No background is required to succeed in this course. [x4]

* Sam has an informal teaching style.

* Collaboration will be important. In the nut butter and jelly exercise, 
  a more precise set of instructions could be made by collaborating with 
  your group.

* Band-aids are necessary for making nut butter and jelly sandwiches.

* Sandwiches are complicated.

* Class can go by quickly.

* Computer science uses its own methodologies, which are not just the 
  scientific method.

* Take notes, even though Sam puts a lot on the EBoard.  Notes can be
  used on the examinations, and in many other situations.

* Stay positive.

* It's okay to say "I'm not sure".

* Mentors can be helpful.

* I may know more than I thought I did.
