Lessons from ...
================

In [assignment 1](../assignments/assignment.01.html), students were asked
to provide two things they learned by reading the course web and two things
they learned from the first day of class.  This document summarizes
their answers.  I have chosen not to credit individual students by name
or initials.  Credit for the compound document therefore belongs to "The 
Students of CSC 151 2015S".
