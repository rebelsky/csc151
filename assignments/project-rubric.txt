NAMES: 

PROJECT THEME: 

PROPOSAL DESIGN STATEMENT [5 points]: The proposal design statement is
complete and accurate.

[ ] 5 The design statement makes excellent use of design terminology to
      explain the intended effects of the images on the viewer, addressing
      both color and composition.

[ ] 4 The design statement uses design terminology correctly and
      justifies the most important aspects of the design.

[ ] 3 The design statement makes some mistakes in using design terminology 
      or fails to discuss some important aspects of the design.

[ ] 2 The design statement does not use appropriate terminology or does 
      not accurately describe the images.

PROPOSAL TECHNIQUE STATEMENT [5 points]: The proposed technique statement
completely and accurately describes the algorithmic techniques used.

[ ] 10 The statement completely and accurately describes the algorithm,
       clearly indicating the three (or more) techniques used. The
       statement persuades the reader that the procedure produces 1000
       distinct images.

[ ] 9 The statement accurately describes the algorithms used but leaves
      a question or two remaining. The statement is somewhat persuasive
      that the procedure produces 1000 distinct images and uses 3
      distinct techniques.

[ ] 8 The statement has some minor inaccuracies or raises several
      questions. There is some attempt to argue that the procedure
      produces 1000 distinct images and uses at least 3 techniques.

[ ] 6 The statement is significantly incomplete and/or inaccurate. 
      The statement does not argue that the code meets the project
      specifications.

FINAL DESIGN STATEMENT [5 points]: The revised design statement is
complete and accurate.

[ ] 5 The design statement makes excellent use of design terminology to
      explain the intended effects of the images on the viewer, addressing
      both color and composition.

[ ] 4 The design statement uses design terminology correctly and
      justifies the most important aspects of the design.

[ ] 3 The design statement makes some mistakes in using design terminology 
      or fails to discuss some important aspects of the design.

[ ] 2 The design statement does not use appropriate terminology or does 
      not accurately describe the images.

[ ] 5 The statement completely and accurately describes the algorithm,
      clearly indicating the three (or more) techniques used. The
      statement persuades the reader that the procedure produces 1000

      a question or two remaining. The statement is somewhat persuasive
      that the procedure produces 1000 distinct images and uses 3
      distinct techniques.

[ ] 3 The statement has some minor inaccuracies or raises several

[ ] 2 The statement is significantly incomplete and/or inaccurate. 
      The statement does not argue that the code meets the project
      specifications.

FORM OF SUBMISSION [5 points]: The work is submitted in the specified
manner with the specified form.

[ ] 5 The work is submitted in the specified manner, with the appropriate 
      files included (statements, code, representative large images, 
      representative scaled/stretched images), and with the each file 
      having an appropriate file name.

[ ] 4 There are one or two minor errors in naming, one file is missing, or
      a similar minor lack of attention to detail.

[ ] 3 Two files are missing, or one file is missing and there are a few
      minor errors in naming, or there are multiple errors in naming, or
      a similar lack of attention to detail.

[ ] 2 More than two files are missing, but the files are named correctly.

[ ] 0 Significant lack of attention to form.

PROCEDURE SIGNATURE [5 points]: The image-series procedure takes an integer
(0 through 999) as a parameter, along with a width and height, and
produces an image of the correct size.

[ ] 5 The procedure has the correct signature and name.

[ ] 4 The procedure has the correct signature but a different name.

[ ] 3 The procedure takes the correct parameters but does not produce 
      a new image.

[ ] 2 The procedure does not take the specified parameters.

IMAGE DISTINCTIVENESS [15 points]: The procedure generates at least 1000
distinct images.

[ ] 15 The procedure generates at least 1000 distinct images.

[ ] 13 Images for nearby values of n are very similar, but distinct upon
       close inspection.

[ ] 11 A few values of n produce images that are indistinguishable from
       each other.

[ ] 8 Some values of n result in errors, or many values of n result in
      indistinguishable images.

IMAGE REPRODUCIBILITY: The images are reproducible and vary based solely on n.

[ ] 5 The images are reproducible.  

[ ] 2 The images are not reproducible, e.g., due to the use of random numbers.

IMAGE SCALABILITY [15 points]: The technique scales and stretches
appropriately. That is, larger images look similar to smaller images
for the same value of n, and the image look similar even if the aspect
ratio changes.

[ ] 15 Scaling and stretching are nearly perfect for all reasonable sizes; 
       any differences are due to fixed brush sizes or rounding error at 
       the pixel level.

[ ] 13 The image mostly scales and stretches correctly but has one or two 
       minor discrepancies.

[ ] 11 Although there is an attempt at scaling and stretching, some element 
       of the image obviously does not scale correctly.

[ ] 8 Although there is an attempt at scaling and stretching, several elements 
      of the image obviously do not scale or stretch correctly.

ALGORITHMIC TECHNIQUES [10 points]: The project uses at least three distinct
techniques for generating images.

[ ] 10 The project develops new techniques or is particularly creative in
       its combination of three or more existing techniques.

[ ] 8 The project uses a novel combination and elaboration of three or 
      more existing techniques.

[ ] 7 The project uses three techniques but does not introduce any new
      ideas.  The project images may resemble work for a prior homework
      assignment.  

[ ] 5 The project uses only one or two techniques.

CODE QUALITY [10 points]: The code is elegant, concise, and efficient.

[ ] 10 The code is nearly flawless in conciseness and efficiency, or impressive
       in its elegance.

[ ] 9 The code has a few minor problems with conciseness or efficiency.

[ ] 8 The code has one significant problem with efficiency or several 
      problems with conciseness.

[ ] 6 The project has significant problems with conciseness and efficiency.

CODE READABILITY [10 points]: The code is well-documented and easy
to understand.

[ ] 10 All procedures are documented with 6Ps. Procedure, parameter, and
       variable names are crystal clear. Code is correctly formatted. Short
       comments explain the purpose of expressions that might otherwise
       be unclear.

[ ] 9 All procedures are documented with the 6Ps and there may be a few
      internal comments where needed. Procedure, parameter, and variable names
      are mostly clear. Code is formatted correctly.

[ ] 8 Most procedures are documented with the 6Ps. Procedure, variable, 
      and parameter names are at least suggestive. Formatting is mostly 
      correct.

[ ] 6 There is little documentation. Much of the code is incorrectly 
      formatted. Several procedures, variables, or parameters have opaque or
      meaningless names.
