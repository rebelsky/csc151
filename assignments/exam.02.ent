    For the physical copy, you must write all of your answers using the
    computer, print them out, number the pages, staple them together
    (except for the cover sheet), and hand me the printed copy.  For your
    benefit and for ours, we are doing <emphasis>blind grading</emphasis>
    on this examination, so you have been assigned a number to use on
    your exam.  Please make sure that your number appears at the top of
    every page.  You should turn in a <emphasis>separate</emphasis> cover
    sheet along with your stapled and printed answers. The cover sheet
    should include (1) the two hand-written academic honesty statements
    (individually signed and dated, if it is appropriate for you to sign
    each), (2) your name, and (3) your assigned number.  If you choose to
    invoke the <quote>there's more to life than computer science</quote>
    option, then you must indicate that option on the cover sheet, and
    you should indicate it <emphasis>only</emphasis> on the cover sheet.
