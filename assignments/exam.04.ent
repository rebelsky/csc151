    For the physical copy, you must write all of your answers using the
    computer, print them out, number the pages, staple them together
    (except for the cover sheet), and hand me the printed copy.  For your
    benefit and for ours, we are doing <emphasis>blind grading</emphasis>
    on this examination, so you have been assigned a number to use on
    your exam.  Please make sure that your number appears at the top of
    every page.  You should turn in a <emphasis>separate</emphasis> cover
    sheet along with your stapled and printed answers. The cover sheet
    should include (1) the two hand-written academic honesty statements
    (individually signed and dated, if it is appropriate for you to sign
    each), (2) your name, and (3) your assigned number.  If you choose to
    invoke the <quote>there's more to life than computer science</quote>
    option, the you must indicate that option on the cover sheet, and
    you should indicate it <emphasis>only</emphasis> on the cover sheet.

    You must also submit the code for your examination at <ulink 
    url='&exam4-submit-url;'/>.  Ideally, you would put all of the code
    for the exam in a single Racket file.  However, if you have created 
    separate files for the separate parts of the exam, you can just paste 
    them one after another when you submit, provided you put a clear
    separator, such as <code>; PROBLEM 2</code>, between sections.
