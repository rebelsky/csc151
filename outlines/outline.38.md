Outline 38: Another Image Model: Iterating Over Positions
=========================================================

Held: Monday, 11 November 2013

Back to [Outline 37 - Randomized (Unpredictable) Drawing](outline.37.html).
On to [Outline 39 - On Two-Dimensional Design](outline.39.html).

**Summary**

We consider a simple approach to working with images - looping over
the positions in an image and computing a new color based on positional
information.  We then explore some applications of this approach.

**Administrivia**

* Exam 2 returned.  I'll be sending out an answer key as soon as I'm
  sure that everyone has submitted it.
* Reminder: I get so much email that sometimes I miss some, and often I
  file it automatically without reading it.  If you need me to read your
  email
    * Give it a clear title that indicates that I should read it.  "Homework"
      and "Exam" suggest to me that you are submitting work.
    * Remind me if I haven't responded in a day or two.
    * And remind me again if I still haven't responded.
* I've planned a significant amount of time to talk about assignment 8.
* This Friday we will be moving our class to ARH 302 (3rd floor lecture
  hall) to hear Hilary Mason '00.  Class starts at 12:45.  
     * We won't have a quiz this week.
