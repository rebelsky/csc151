We explore the problem of <em>sorting</em>.  When you sort a list, vector,
or other collection, you put the elements in order.  The order of the
elements usually corresponds to the type of the elements.  We might
sort strings alphabetically, grades numerically, colors by brightness,
and so on and so forth.
