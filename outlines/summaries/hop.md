We revisit the topic of <em>higher-order procedures</em>, one of the most
important techniques in languages like Scheme.  Higher-order procedures
are procedures -- like <code>map</code>, <code>left-section</code>, or 
<code>compose</code> -- that take other procedures
as parameters, return other procedures as values, or both.
