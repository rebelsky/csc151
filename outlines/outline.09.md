Outline 09: An Introduction to the GIMP
=======================================

Held: Friday, 13 September 2013

Back to [Outline 08 - Documenting Programs and Procedures](outline.08.html).
On to [Outline 10 - Programing the GIMP Tools](outline.10.html).

**Summary**

We begin our exploration of <emphasis>GIMP</emphasis>, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.  GIMP is an open-source raster graphics editor,
which is scriptable by a variant of the Scheme programming language.

*See the previous outline for more details.*
* Parts of an algorithm
* What we're doing in this course.

<section id="what-is-gimp" title="What is GIMP?">
* GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) is free software.  (Free
  software is related to open-source software, but with a particular
  political bent.)
* It allows you to create and edit a wide variety of images, all of
  which are pixel-based.  Such images are called *raster images*.
    * A separate kind of graphics is based on drawing primitives, and
    is called *vector graphics*.  
* It is intended as a more open alternative to photoshop.

<section id="why-gimp" title="So Why Study the GIMP in 151?">
* This is "An introduction to CS" not "Digital Art".  So,
  why are we studying this GIMP thingy?
* The GIMP is scriptable, giving us the opportunity to write algorithms.
* About eight years ago, I added a short GIMP section to 151.
* About five years ago, I saw some evidence that introductory CS courses
  that emphasize image manipulation better served a wider variety of
  students, and decided to adapt that approach to our courses.
    * I applied for a grant, waited, waited some more, and finally got it.
* We had the first GIMP-based 151 two years ago, it had some success, 
  so we continue to use and refine it.
* I built MediaScheme, the scripting software for the GIMP on my
  sabbatical last year.  It was used for the first time last spring,
  and seemed more successful than the previous software we were using.

<section id="gimp-demo" title="A Short Demo">
* Not scripted.

<section id="gimp-lab" title="Lab">
* Do [](../Labs/gimp-lab.html)the lab</a>.

<section id="gimp-reflect" title="Reflect">
* We'll try a few of your algorithms.
* We'll also try to reflect a bit on what you learned or didn't learn.
