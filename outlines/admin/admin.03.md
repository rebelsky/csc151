* Meet Jennelle Nystrom, our Tuesday mentor.
* Evening tutors start tomorrow night and will work 7pm-10pm Sunday
  to Thursday.
    * If you feel you need additional tutoring, we can arrange small
      group tutors and individual tutors
* I've traditionally taught today's class starting with lecture and then 
  followed with lab.  As part of my attempt to lecture less, we're going 
  to try reversing that order.
* I've assigned [partners](../partners/2013-09-03.txt) today.
    * Look at one of the sheets scattered around the room (or at the
      Partners link on the Web site) and find your partners.
    * Groups of three should probably use the computers at the east 
      end of the room, since they are easier to group around.
* We plan to distribute your first homework assignment tomorrow.
* Readings for tomorrow:
  [Numeric Values in Scheme](../readings/numbers-reading.html)
  [Symbolic Values in Scheme](../readings/symbols-reading.html)
* Any EC opportunities?
