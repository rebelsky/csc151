### Too Many Tallies

Here are some of the ways that students wrote `irgb-tally-dark`.  Which
do you prefer?

    (define irgb-tally-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (cond
          [(null? lst) 0]
          [(irgb-dark? (car lst))
           (+ 1 (irgb-tally-dark (cdr lst)))]
          [else
           (irgb-tally-dark (cdr lst))])))

    (define irgb-tally-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (if (null? lst)
            0
            (if (irgb-dark? (car lst))
                (+ 1 (irgb-tally-dark (cdr lst)))
                (irgb-tally-dark (cdr lst))))))

    (define irgb-tally-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (if (null? lst)
            0
            (+ (if (irgb-dark? (car lst)) 1 0)
               (irgb-tally-dark (cdr lst))))))

    (define irgb-tally-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (- (length lst) (length (irgb-filter-out-dark lst)))))

    (define irgb-tally-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (length (irgb-select-dark lst))))

    (define irgb-select-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (cond
          [(null? lst) null]
          [(irgb-dark? (car lst))
           (cons (car lst)
                 (irgb-select-dark (cdr lst)))]
          [else
           (irgb-select-dark (cdr lst))])))

    (define irgb-tally-dark
      (lambda (lst)
        (sum (map (lambda (val) (if (irgb-dark? val) 1 0))))))
