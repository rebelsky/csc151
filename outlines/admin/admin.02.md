* Reminder: If you expect to have a long-standing interest in CS (even if
  you don't plan to be a CS major), you can be on the csstudents mailing
  list and you can participate in CS Table.  Email me to get added to
  the mailing list.
    * CS Table meets in JRC 224A at Noon on Fridays.  We pay for your
      meal if you're a student not on board.
    * This week, we're reading Alan Turing's [Computing Machinery and
      Intelligence](http://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf).
* The CS SEPC is hosting a study break tonight at 8pm in the CS Commons.
  Feel free to attend.
* With over sixty surveys between my two classes, I didn't have time
  to respond to all of them yet.  (If I'm lucky, I can respond to a
  survey in 10 minutes.)  Give me a few days.
    * You can find some answers to questions in [the
      FAQ](../handouts/faq.html).  
    * I'm also preparing a [summary of
      lessons](../handouts/lessons.html).
* Very few people even bothered to look up PGP or IRC.
    * We will be using IRC starting next week, but I will give you a
      short in-class introduction first.
    * And since some folks are concerned about revalations about Microsoft
      or the NSA, you might want to learn about PGP.
* For today's lab (and only today's lab), I'll try to have one of you 
  per computer.  We will need to spread out to both labs, and even across
  the hallway.
* You have four (!) short readings for tomorrow: 
  [The Parts of an Algorithm](../readings/algorithms-reading.html),
  [The DrRacket Programming Enviornment](../readings/drracket-reading.html),
  [Beginning Scheme](../readings/beginning-scheme-reading.html), and
  [How Scheme Evaluates Expresssions (take 1)](../readings/scheme-eval-1.html).
* I'll note that Dr. Davis and I seem to have taken very different approaches
  to today's class.
* Instead of taking attendance, I will hand out out account information
  for the CS department workstations.
