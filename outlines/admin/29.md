* Reading for tomorrow: [Preconditions, Revisited](../readings/preconditions-reading.html)
* No new lab writeup.  Feel free to continue work on Friday's writeup.
* I probably won't be caught up on grading until after break.  Sorry.
* Sorry for the confusion on Friday's lab.  We had rearranged topics and
  hadn't caught all of the prerequisite assumptions.
* Continue with your partners from Friday.
