* Reading for Tuesday: [Building Images by Iterating Over Positions](../readings/iterate-positions-reading.html)
* Our computer system is (still) acting up.  Some aspects of lab may take
  longer than they should.
* A few of you are frustrated that your indentation changes when you
  cut and paste into Google docs.  If you use Chromium for accessing
  Google docs, cut and paste *should* work.
* I *think* I only got one request for a partner on the current homework,
  but we'll do a quick survey.
* Study break tonight at 8pm.
* Writeup: Exercise 5, Parts b-f
    * Subject: CSC 151.02 Writeup 15: Anonymous Procedures (OPTIONAL NAMES)
