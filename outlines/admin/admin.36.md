* Today's writeup: Exercise 6
* New assignment: Mostly building color trees.
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities:
    * Any one Grinnell prize event this week.
    * Thursday extras next week: Reports from internships (I think)
    * Grinnell Town Hall Meeting, Nov 13 noon or 7:30, I believe
    * CS Table, Friday: TBD (it's been a bad week)
