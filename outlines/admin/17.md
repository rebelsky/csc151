* Continue partners!
* Friday the 13th falls on Friday next month.  Be careful.
* *Exam 1 to be returned today*.  
    * I do not report averages or ranges or other statistics.  You know
      what your grade means, there's no reason to hear the rest.
    * I recommend that you do not discuss your grade with a classmate.
      You can ask about solutions to problems, but there is no benefit
      to discussing what grade you got.
    * **Do not post solutions anywhere.**
    * Note that if you got under 70 before TMTL, I will fill in an APR for 
      you.  The APR serves as a note to your adviser and to academic
      advising that you are having difficulty.  If you needed TMTL, then
      please talk to me and Prof. Weinman about getting an individual
      or small-group tutor.  (Also please come see me today or next week.)
    * Some cover sheets are missing.  I'll need some help identifying
      your exams.  Random numbers (easy) or your program code (harder) 
      will work.
    * Notes on the exam distributed via email.  Please do not share.
* Tomorrow, you will have the choice whether or not to have a partner
  for the homework.  One set of placement cards will be "no partner".
  One will be "with partner".  I need an estimate of how many people
  want to work alone.  (This time, your eyes, rather than mine, are
  closed.)
