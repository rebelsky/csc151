### Notes on Quiz 1

    * An opportunity for me to discover what you do and don't understand.
    * An opportunity for you to discover what you do and don't understand.
    * An incentive for you to review materials.
    * Intended to be relatively "low stakes".
* Note 1: Every real number in DrRacket is also rational.
* Note 2: `ceiling` gives an inexact output when given an inexact input.
* Note 3: Although I think of the card as the input to the algorithm in
  problem 2, I accepted anything that was argued well.
