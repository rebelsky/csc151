### Exam Notes

_Are there some questions and answers in [yesterday's eboard](../eboards/extra.09.html)?_

> Yes.  I've also copied some of them into the exam.

_What interesting questions have you seen in the prologue?_

> Amazingly, most of the people who have responded to the prologue included
  "start early" in their list of approaches.

> Someone asked how many different tests I wrote for problem 2.  My "first
  pass" set of tests explored eleven different issues, including two 
  kinds of preconditions that might be checked.

> Many of you seem overly enamored of `append`, particularly for problem
  1.  If you are only adding one element to the front of a list, you
  should probably use `cons`.

> I'm trying to figure out what `char-drypot` is.  Maybe auto-correct.

> I appreciate that at least one of you noted that for both problems 5 and
  problem 6, you were likely to lose a lot of points if you failed to get
  the turtle back to the original position and orientation.

_Should I use direct or helper recursion for problem 1?_

> It strikes me that direct recursion is better.  I forgot to mention it
  on Wednesday, but if you're building a new list, and you want the elements
  mostly in the same order, direct recursion is often the way to go.

_Can we see pictures for problem 8?_

> Done.
