* I've gotten reinforcement that Problem 5 is really easy once you think
  it through (of course, the statement was preceded by "Sam, you are evil").  
  So, to reiterate the Q&A section: 
    * `for-each` typically takes a procedure and a list as parameters.
    * Think about the form of the list that you will give as an argument to
      `for-each` in this problem.
    * Think about what type of value the procedure you give as an argument 
      to `for-each` will take as its input.
    * For example, what do you know about `x` in 
      `(for-each (lambda (x) ...) (iota 10))`?
