* I sometimes forget to update links and lists of files (e.g., the link
  to the current reading).
    * Let me know if links seem to be missing.  ALL CAPS EMAIL is fine.
* No attendance.  I'll just ask names as I go.
* I think I've responded to all of the lab writeups I received by 9pm  on
  Thursday night.  (If you sent it later, I'll get to it this weekend.)
    * Please send lab writeups to me.  Your graders don't need to see
      them.
* There are some useful notes in the eboard from yesterday's extra class.
* We'll be moving the extra session to 3:15 on Thursdays.  I hope that's
  okay.  (I'll be playing with timing a bit.)
* The first real homework assignment has been posted.  
     * You have assigned partners for the homework, which are posted today.
* Reading for Monday: Drawings as values.  Our first experience in using
  images as a data type.
* Today's lab writeup, Extra problem 1  
     * Due before class on Monday.
     * Email subject: 
       CSC 151 Writeup 2: Numeric Computation (YOUR NAME(s) HERE)
     * You can, but need not, write up the lab with your partner.
* Extra credit: 
     * Theatre Gigante on Friday.  Some piece on Spaulding Grey.  Yes, 
       tickets are still available.
     * Thursday at 4:15: Spencer Liberto, Lea Marolt Sonnenschein, and 
       Daniel Torres on Ushahidi and more.
     * Others?
