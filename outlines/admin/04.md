* How many people would use lab tutors on Sundays from 3-5 pm if we added
  a shift then?
* Homework comments:
    * My goal is that homework should be no more than three hours.  If
      you're finding that it's taking much more (or that you're on track
      to take much more), you should talk to me.
    * I hear that getting three Grinnellians together is hard.  I'll shoot
      for partners on most remaining assingnments.
