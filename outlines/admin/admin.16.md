* I realize that there's crud going around campus.  Do yourself and your
  classmates a favor and get rest if you are sick.  Drop me a note to let
  me know.
* We have a new homework assignment.  The only thing my random procedure
  paid attention to was whether or not you asked to work alone.
* Continue lab partners!
* I'm going to have an optional class this Thursday at 1:15 (and, I hope, most
  Thursdays) as a chance to talk to folks about more things that might be
  useful or interesting.
    * We won't have the optional class Thursday the 3rd, as I'll be
      unavailable.
* Work for Friday: 
    * Review [the homework assignment](../assignments/assignment.04.html)
    * Read [Anonymous Procedures](../readings/anonymous-procedures.html)
    * Do lab writeup 5 if you haven't done so already.
    * Do lab writeup 6: Etercise 5 from the Lists of Drawings Lab
        * Due before class on Friday.  
        * Title: "CSC 151.02 Lab Writeup 6: Lists (NAME)".
