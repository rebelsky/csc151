### Upcoming Work

* Reading for Wednesday:
  [Recursion Basics](../readings/recursion-basics-reading.html) 
    * Warning! For some, this will be even more confusing than
      `section`.  For others, it will be intuitive.  We will spend
      a few weeks trying to make it intuitive for everyone.
* [HW 5](../assignments/assignment.05.html) due tonight.
* Today's Lab writeup (due before class Friday)
    * Email to <grader-151-01@cs.grinnell.edu> 
    * Subject: _CSC 151 Lab Writeup Class 23 (Your Names)_
    * Exercise: 
* Exam 2 distributed.
    * We'll go through it quickly.
    * Probably lots of opportunities for corrections :-)
