* Continue lab partners.
* No Sam tomorrow.  Prof. Weinman will run class.
* Office hours: Thu/Fri 1:45-3:15; Also walking hours Thu/Fri 1:15-1:45.
* I've started a short reference on 
  [error messages](../reference/error-messages.html).  Please feel
  free to pass along some you get.
* Two important recent comments from students.
    * "I realized that it would be much easier to do the test and study
       for quizzes if I took notes along the way."
          * Sam's followup: There's evidence that you learn simply by
            taking notes (at least if you take notes by hand).
          * Sam's followup: Many of you reread labs and readings in preparation
            for the quizzes.  I expect that read+notes+review notes takes
            less time than read+read.
    * "In high school, I did homework at night (or in the early morning).
       I learned that I'm much better off doing homework in my open slots
       during the day, rather than waiting until night time."
          * Sam's followup: You're also more awake during the day.
          * Sam's followup: There's more help available during the day.
