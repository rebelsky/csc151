  hall) to hear Hilary Mason '00.  Class starts at 12:45.  
     * We won't have a quiz this week.
* Grading:
    * Homework is reduced to 5% of your grade.  The other 5% goes to the
      best of homework/quizzes/labs.
    * I will see how much I can grade through this coming weekend (which is 
      the next reasonable chunk of free time I have).  
        * Default grade on ungraded work is "check".
        * After you get the grades back, you can request that I grade
          any ungraded assignment.
        * Note that I need to grade both classes, and I do have to do
          class prep and things other than work.
    * Default on all past assignments
