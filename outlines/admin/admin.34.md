* No writeup for today!
* It's almost time for preregistration.  Are you enjoying CS?  You should
  continue.
    * CSC 161, Imperative Problem Solving, is the next course.  
       * It focuses on on something closer to the Turtle model
       * That is, in 161 we worry much more about sequencing operations and
         we worry about the state of the system.
       * In 161, we also look much more "behind the scenes" (somewhat like
         what we're doing today).
       * 161 uses C as the programming language.
    * MAT/CSC 208, Discrete Structures, is also useful.  It introduces
      you to some of the mathematics you need to better understand and
      analyze algorithms and data structures.
    * CSC 195 is my "pre-research" course, but it's open to all comers.
* It might also be worthwhile to start thinking about next summer (whether
  or not you are continuing in CS).  You only get three summers of college,
  so you should make the most of them.
    * (Story about NYTimes internship.)
    * Using summer well: 
        * Explore potential directions (it's fine to have many, but the only 
          way to narrow is to explore).
        * Build skills.
        * Build your resume.
    * If you're interested in CS, you should go to this week's CS extra
      and the week 14 CS extra on "Summer Opportunities in CS".
    * In any case, you should make the time to visit with the CDO.
* I'll reserve time for general exam questions.
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities:
    * Any one Grinnell prize event this week.
    * Thursday extras next week: Reports from internships (I think)
    * Grinnell Town Hall Meeting, Nov 13 noon or 7:30, I believe
    * CS Table, Friday: TBD
