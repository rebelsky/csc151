* Welcome back!  I hope you had a good break.
   * I spent my break trying to get the disk images working on Windows,
     doing some other development for Mediascript, helping a colleague
     with a programming problem, and grading for my other class.  I have
     not caught up on grading for your class.  (Our grader has also not
     caught up on grading.)
