* Welcome to CSC 151.  I hope you have a great time.
* I anticipate this being a large class.  (I agreed to go over the cap.)
  I will sign the add form of anyone who is here today.
* I will take attendance for the first few weeks of class.  I have 120
  students this semester, so it's going to take me a little while to learn
  everyone's name.
* I don't believe in going over class policies on the first day of class.
  Please read the course web and ask me questions via email or in person.
* I'm trying to set up a Google calendar for this course.  Please let me
  know what else you'd like to see on that calendar.
* Extra credit: MLK Day Talk, tonight @ 7:30 in JRC 101.
* Extra credit: Thursday extra on summer research in CS, Thursday @ 4:30 
  in Noyce 3821.
* Extra credit: CS Table Friday at noon in the Day PDR in the Marketplace.
* Your first assignment is due Tuesday night at 10:30 p.m.  I have
  distributed it in class today.
* You also have readings for class tomorrow.  You can find the described
  in today's assignment.
