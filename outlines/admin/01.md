* Welcome to CSC 151.  I hope you have a great time.
* I anticipate this being a large class.  (I agreed to go over the cap.)
  I will sign the add form of anyone who is here today.
* Your first assignment is due Tusday night at 10:30 p.m.
* I don't believe in going over class policies on the first day of class.
  Please read the course web and ask me questions via email or in person.
* I'm trying to set up a Google calendar for this course.  Please let me
  know what else you'd like to see on that calendar.
