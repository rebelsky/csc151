* Don't forget that we have class on Monday!
* Welcome to CSC 151.  I hope you have a great time!  
  (Particular welcomes to the first-year students.)
* Warning!  Your first assignment is due this Sunday at 10:30 p.m.  
  (And yes, you have to complete the assignment even if you are not yet 
   registered for the course.)
* This course is very overenrolled.  Please put up with the extra chaos 
  for the first few days.  Please also let me know asap if you are dropping 
  the course so that I can add poeple from the waiting list.
* I don't believe in going over class policies on the first day.  Please
  read the course web and ask me questions via irc, email, or in the next
  class.
