### Notes on Exam 2

* Exam 2 is graded but will not be returned until Wednesday because a few
  people have extensions until Tuesday night.
* Academic honesty issue 1: *Many students were careless in citing code 
  from readings/labs/homework.*
    * You are expected to cite anything that's not the exam.
    * The College does expect me to report failure to cite to the
      Committee on Academic Standing.  Neither you nor I want that to
      happen.
    * If you neglected to cite because of misunderstanding of polices,
      please get citations to me by 5pm today.
* Academic honesty issue 2: *I received reports of students collaborating
  on the exam.*
    * "I saw some of your students talking about the exam."
    * "I heard the following conversation: 'How do you make the
      code faster?'  'Use a `let`.'"  (Conversation simulated.)
    * "I don't feel comfortable signing the second statement."
    * Let's treat this in an exercise in self governance.  I'll work with
      both classes on deciding what to do.  But you need some time to reflect,
      so at the start of class on Tuesday, we will discuss how I might handle 
      this issue.
