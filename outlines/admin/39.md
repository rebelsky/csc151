### Exam Notes

_I'm worried that my polygon procedures are drawing polygons at the 
 top-left corner of the image, rather than at the center._

> Your procedures should draw the polygons wherever the turtle is.
  If the turtle starts in the top-left corner, then you should draw
  the polygon there.
