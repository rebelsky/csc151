* Sit with your homework partners!
* When you send me questions, it's very helpful if you send me the examples
  that are not working correctly and *all* the code that I'll need to
  run those examples.  (It spares me from either asking you or rewriting
  the code myself.)  For example, if your example uses `my-drawing` and
  `shift-to-origin`, send me the code for `my-drawing` and `shift-to-origin`.
* I've gotten enough questions that we will spend much of today's class 
  working on the homework assignment so that you can get assistance from
  the mentors and from me.
