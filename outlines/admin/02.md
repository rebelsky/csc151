* Grab a not-quite-blank playing card, identify where the associated
  computer is, and sit by that computer.
* In case you didn't know, there is a course Web site at 
  <http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CSC151/2015S/>.
  We'll do a quick overview.
* Two quotations
    * "Don't take 151, they're going to teach you a useless language.
       Take Web Development so you can learn HTML." (Overheard in mailroom)
    * "I wish someone had told me that Scheme was just Javascript with a 
       better syntax.  Now that I understand that, I wish I'd taken more
       CS." (Graduating senior who developed Web consultancy.)
* I'll try to take attendance quickly today.
