* Welcome back to CSC 151!  I'm still Sam.  Our mentors are still Erin 
  and Zachary.
* I use online signup for my office hours.  Form at
  <https://rebelsky.youcanbook.me>.  You can also email me about other
  times, but check my schedule first.
* Please grab today's lab manual from the mentors.
* The computer science department maintains a mailing list for assorted
  announcements (talks, discussions, study breaks, internship opportunities,
  etc.).  Please drop me an email message if you'd like to be added.  
* There still seem to be some students in the afternoon section of CSC 151
  who would have better schedules if they could take the morning section.
  If you'd be willing to trade to the afternoon section, please let
  me know.
* Our students want you to know that some Grinnellians are going to
  Global Hack V the weekend of Sept. 11-13 in St. Louis.  Free 
  registration for Grinnell students!  Further information ont he
  Web site at <http://globalhack.org/> and from
  [kyaruzia17] and [kittaneh17].

### Scattered Notes on HW1

* Apologies to the first few people whose HW1 I graded.  I spaced on my
  grading scheme, and used check/plus/minus rather than vg/good/fair/poor.
* Please follow the instructions for the form and title of the HW1
  submissions.
* I've started a [list of lessons](../handouts/lessons.html) that
  students have provided in their introductory surveys.

### Scattered Notes on Today's Lab

* We'll be doing the lab at the end of class.  When you finish the lab,
  you can leave.
* When we do today's lab, we will probably move some students into the
  neighboring room so everyone can have his, her, or zir own computer.
* We had some significant upgrades to our computer systems this summer.
  I've done my best to update the lab to incorporate those changes, but
  I probably missed something.  

### Upcoming Work

* Lots of short readings for Tuesday:
  [Parts of Algorithms](../readings/algorithms-reading.html) (review),
  [The DrRacket Program-Development Environment](../readings/drracket-reading.html),
  [Beginning Scheme](../readings/beginning-scheme-reading.html), and
  [How Scheme Evaluates Expressions (Take 1)](../readings/scheme-eval-1.html).
