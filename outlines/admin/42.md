### Project Notes

* Remember that you need at least three different approaches from the
  menu of Gimp tools, Turtles, image-compute, image-variant, drawings
  as values, and color trees.  (If you want to suggest another, ....)
* `(image-redo! image (lambda (x y color) newcolor))` is the generalization
  of `image-transform!` and `image-compute`.
