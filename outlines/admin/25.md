*I did not take time last week to condemn the postings on Yik Yak
because I thought the president's statement sufficed.  But it sounds
like individual voices are necessary, too.  And, as a technologist,
I have particular responsibility to comment in this case.  So I should
have done so more promptly.  I apologize for the delay, particularly
because this issue is very important to me.*

**Let me make it absolutely clear.  Use of any medium - social,
physical, virtual - to denigrate other people for their characteristics
is completely unacceptable.  I have updated our course front door to
clarify this perspective.  (If you have comments on how to better phrase
my policy, I would appreciate them.)**
