* We seem to have a misunderstanding about workload.  If you're spending more
  than five hours on a homework assignment, something has gone wrong and we
  should talk.  
    * Preferably, you would realize that you were going to spend that much
      time before, say, 8pm on Tuesday night.
    * If you hit more than five hours, it's making sense, and you really 
      want to do the last bit, that's fine.
    * But if you're stuck, you should come to see me.
* Lab writeup: Extra 1 from today's lab, due Friday before class.
* Reading for Friday: [Transforming RGB Colors](../readings/transforming-rgb-reading.html)
* It sounds like there may be room for one more person in Dr. Davis's
  11:00 a.m. section of 151.  So, if you'd like to switch sections,
  let her know asap.  
* I plan to email you your current grade info by Friday.
* SACNAS Ice Cream Social Thursday, September 19th at 8:00PM in the 
  Biology Commons
* EC Opportunities:
    * CS Extras Thursday @ 4:30: Kim Spasaro on Linguistics Programming
    * CS Table Friday (Pair programming)
    * Other?
* I also encourage you to attend any of the other Title IX talks/events.
* We're going to try an experiment today.  Instead of giving my start-of-class
  lecture and clicker questions, I'm going to let you ask about five 
  questions on the readings.
* [Exam 1](../exams/exam.01.html) distributed and quickly discussed.
    * There will be time at the start of class for questions on 
      Friday, Monday, and Tuesday.  
    * I'll also add some Q&A to the exam itself.  Please check it
      regularly.
