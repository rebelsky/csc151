* Maintain lab partners from yesterday.
* Quick observations from epilogues
    * Part D was clearly the hardest part.  I hope it was useful.
    * Epilogues should be individual.  Don't do them with your partner.
    * A bit of frustration on lack of textbook and availability of help.
    * I generally expect homework assignments to take 2-4 hours.
    * Mostly positive group experiences, but some scheduling difficulties.
    * Sunday mentor hours?
* Favorite quote: "It seems like every time I think something is going
  to be easy, it's complex, and every time I think something is going to
  be complex, it's easy."
* It's weekend.  Please reflect in advance on what decisions will be
  appropriate for you.  And if you choose to drink, please drink responsibly.
