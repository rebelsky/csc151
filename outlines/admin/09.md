* Today's writeup (due Wednesday): Exercise 2 from Testing
    * Email subject:
      CSC 151 Writeup 6: Testing (YOUR NAME(s) HERE)
* Our graders would like you to know that all the writeups should go to 
  me, not to them.  (Assignments, on the other hand, go to the graders.)
* I sent you a grade status report this morning.  
    * I'll try to send those weekly, probably on Sunday nights.
    * At some point, they'll include a bit of computation.
* Quizzes were definitely mixed.  Don't stress out about it too much.
* It's a new week, it must be time for new partners!
    * This week's policy: Mixed-sex groups, as much as possible.
    * Next week's policy: Same-sex groups, similar confidence levels.
        * Expect a confidence-level survey soon.
* A few of you are having some trouble with homework partners who don'
  t make meetings.  If a partner doesn't make a meeting, the other two 
  should still make progress, so feel free to work on it without them.  
    * If, when you submit an assignment, you feel that your partner has not 
      contributed enough, let me know when you submit your assignment.
