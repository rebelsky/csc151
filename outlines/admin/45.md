### Project Tips

Image-making techniques

* Drawings as values, with or without recursion
* `image-variant`, `image-transform!
    * Also `(image-redo! image (lambda (col row color) ...)`
    * `image-transform!` and `image-redo!` behave differently with
      selections.
* `image-compute`
* Gimp tools, with or without recursion
* Turtle graphics

I've added a variety of project tips that I thought we'd look at
quickly.  

* Recoloring a turtle's drawing.  (Needs improvement.)
* Selecting a polygon.

You can also find a few others on the tips page, such as a procedure 
to copy and paste.
