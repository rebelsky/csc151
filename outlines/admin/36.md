* New Partners!
* Grades distributed via email.  
    * Yes, I take comments and corrections.
    * No, you can't now do the labs you missed.  
    * As some of you have discovered, I didn't catch all absences, but 
      I caught many, and absences do affect your grade.
    * I have promised a number of people that I will revisit their exam 2
      grade at the end of the semester and see how much of an impact
      dropping it has had.  I will do so for anyone who asks me during
      finals week.
