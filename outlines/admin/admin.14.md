* Study break tonight at 8 pm.
* My other class wants the "Current EBoard" link to give the source file,
  rather than the HTML.  Do you care?
* Any parents coming Friday?  (I'm trying to figure out how to fit them.)
* I've gotten a few "I don't think I should ask you this" emails.  If you 
  are asking questions via email, I don't consider anything out of bounds.
  (I may refuse to answer, but I won't be bothered that you've asked.)
* New lab partners!
* Lots of folks had trouble with the GIMP tools stuff.  I didn't need exact
  code, but I wanted to be able to have a sense that you understood the
  "choose color" -> "select area" -> "fill" order of things.
* I'm going to have an optional class this Thursday at 1:15 (and, I hope, most
  Thursdays) as a chance to talk to folks about more things that might be
  useful or interesting.
* For those who missed the documentation lab writeup, here's an alternative.
  Document the following procedure
<pre>
(define range
  (lambda (val cap)
    (+ 1 (modulo (- val 1) cap))))
</pre>
* Work for Tuesday
    * Continue to work on the exam
    * Reading for Tuesday: [Transforming Images](../readings/transforming-images-reading.html)
    * Lab writeup 4: Problems 6a and 7b from Transforming RGB Colors.  
      Due before class on Wednesday.  (Ideally before class on Tuesday.)
* EC Opportunities:
    * CS Extras Thursday @ 4:30: Jennelle Nystrom on working at Microsoft
    * CS Table Friday (The Story of Mel)
    * Other?  (Water polo, Football, G-Tones, ...)
