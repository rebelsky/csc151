* There is no lab writeup for today.
* There is, however, a quiz today.
* And a reading for tomorrow.
* Note: When grading lab writeups, I
    * Look in the folder where I file writeups when I arrive
    * Search in my mailbox for all the mail meeting the title of the lab
    * Search in my mailbox for all mail from people who don't seem to have
      submitted the lab
    * If I don't find your lab writeup after all of that, I have to assume
      that you have not submitted it.
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities:
    * "Data Sovreignty: The Challenge of Geolocating Data in the Cloud",
