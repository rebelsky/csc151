* New Partners!
* Review sessions Thursday at 9:15am (Sam), 1:15pm (Sam), and 8pm (Alex).
* After reflecting, I flipped the topics for today's class and Friday's class.
  Sorry!
* Exam 2 returned.
* Strongest arguments: 
    * "The main goal of the exams is that we learn.  We've learned.  Exam grades
       are likely to be relatively consistent across exams, so not counting this exam
       is unlikely to have an effect on students who did not get inappropriate help."
    * "Many of us worked very hard on this exam and should see rewards for our
       hard work."
    * "You should have a policy that does not discourage people from coming forward."

### Upcoming Work
