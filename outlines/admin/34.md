* Continue partners.
* I hope you had a wonderful weekend and found ways to enjoy the sun.
* Extended/modified office hours continue this week.  (More variation than
  normal; sorry.)
* Welcome to any prospective students!
* It's preregistration time.  Let me know if you have questions about
  our other courses.  (Email or in-person visits will be fine.)
* Some students in a review session said (approximately): "No one reads
  the eboards" (presumably, except during class).  Double-blind vote (Evan
  counts, you and I close our eyes): 
    * Do you find eboards useful?
    * Should I keep doing eboards?
* Quiz 8 will be returned during lab.  We will go over it first.
