* Exam 2 returned.  I'll be sending out an answer key as soon as I'm
  sure that everyone has submitted it.
* Reminder: I get so much email that sometimes I miss some, and often I
  file it automatically without reading it.  If you need me to read your
  email

      and "Exam" suggest to me that you are submitting work.
