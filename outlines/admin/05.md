* Lab partners assigned for the week.  (This is a "same sex" week as part
  of our broader partner preference experiment.)
* We had a family emergency this weekend, so it will take me a few more
  days to respond to your introductory surveys.  (Yours is my largest
  class, so you folks are last.)
* Study break in the CS commons at 8pm tonight.  Home-made (well, probably
  apartment-made) cookies.
* The TC Corps is hiring!  Contact [tranchri] or [cohnhann] for details.
    * Probably other people, too.
* I've graded your first quiz.  I'll return it during class, possibly
  while you are doing lab.
    * No other attendance.
* I've changed my homework grading strategy a bit, to "Excellent, Very 
  Good, Good, Fair, Poor" (it's more or less the same as the old check
  system, but with new words).  Updates to the handouts will follow.
* Note that if you use the "Source" version of an EBoard, you should 
  see the stuff within a minute or two of me updating it.
* I think I've responded to all of the lab writeups I've received.
    * Please send lab writeups to me.  Your graders don't need to see
      them.
* We will continue today's lab tomorrow.  
     * Please read ahead: Procedures as values
* Today's lab writeup (due Friday): Exercise 4, parts a, c, d, f, and g
     * Email subject: 
       CSC 151 Writeup 3: Drawings as Values (YOUR NAME(s) HERE)
     * You can, but need not, write up the lab with your partner.
* Extra credit: 
     * Thursday at 4:15: Spencer Liberto, Lea Marolt Sonnenschein, and 
       Daniel Torres on Ushahidi and more.
     * CS Table Friday at Noon: The ACM Code of Ethics.
     * Convo Feb. 5. (I'll give my "Why go to convo" lecture closer to the date.)
     * Others?
