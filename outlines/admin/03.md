* Keep the same partners from the last class.
* Lots of preliminaries today!
* The index cards in the back of the room are to support your note-taking 
  systems.
    * I would recommend using the white cards for vocabulary.
    * I would recommend using one color for grammar (syntactic structures).
    * I would recomment using one color for algorithmic concepts.
    * You can think about how to use other colors.
    * *Please be responsible in your consumption of the cards.*
* In case you didn't know, you can submit questions anonymously
  via the "Submit Questions" link.
* No attendance today; the quizzes serve for attendance.
* I keep eboards for the review sessions, too.  You can find links to
  them in the obvious places.
* I told you on Wednesday that I keep changing the number of key things
  that can go into algorithms.  I realize that I left out one in our
  discussions: You need to rely on *basic operations* that the person
  or device carrying out the algorith already knows.
* Since it's weekend, a few reminders.
    * Consider in advance what you want and what you feel comfortable with.
    * If you choose to partake, please partake responsibly.
    * Remember that consent is difficult to give or receive if you
      have been partaking.
