About the project
-----------------

* For the few weeks of class, you'll be working on a project that
  we call "a procedure is worth 1000 pictures".
* Broad goal: Think about the tools and concepts you've learned and
  apply them in a different way.
* Your goal: Write a procedure that, given a number, n, and an image
  size, produces an *interesting* image.
    * Different n - Different images.
    * Same n - Same image.
    * Different sizes - Scales appropriately.
* Note that different people find different things interesting.
* One of my colleagues in art suggests that a piece is interesting if 
  the viewer cannot easily look at the image and say "I get it".
    * Sometimes you add interest by violating expectations or by contrasting
      opposites.
    * Sometimes you add interest by referring to things outside of
      your work (most typically, other works in the history of art).
    * Most often, you add interest by thinking carefully about a variety
      of design principles.
* I find that you make more interesting work by focusing on *relationships*:
  The relationship between different components of the piece, the relationship
  between the piece and others in the series, the relationship between the
  piece and the broader world.

Some design components
----------------------

* *Color* is certainly a huge component of your design.  Refer back to
  things we've said about color and color palettes.
* The *picture plane* is the surface on which you compose your image.
* A *line* is an explicit or implicit connection between two or more
  points.  
    * Curves connect a lot of points.
    * Implicit lines are typically straight lines.
    * We can also talk about qualities of the line - thin, thick, varying,
      color, ...
* A *shape* is a coherent area on the surface, typically distinguished
  from the surrounding area by a line or by different color values.
    * Some shapes are regular.
    * Some shapes are geometric.
    * Some shapes are more "organic".
    * We can play with positive/negative shape (what's the fore, what's
      the ground?)
* *Texture* is the visual or tactile quality of a surface.
   * Some textures simulate real textures in the world (wood, fur, etc.)
   * Some textures are fully or partially invented, such as the color
     blends we make with `image-compute`.

Relationships between elements
------------------------------

There are many ways to show relationships between the elements of an
image, and these relationships are at the heart of your image.  Broadly,
you should think about *unity* (how are things the same) and *variety*
how do things differ.

* *Proximity* of two objects provides one connection.  (Contrast *Distance*)
* *Grouping* of elements is possible.  (Contrast *Separation*)
* *Repetition* of elements provides one form of repetition, and gives a
  sense of *rhythm* to the piece.  (Contrast *Variation*) I find images
  that combine repetition and variation particularly interesting)
* We can put the elements in a regular (or not so regular) *grid*
* *Scale* and *proportion* show additional relationships.

Broader design elements
-----------------------

(Yeah, it's a slippery slope as to what we classify where.)

* Different objects have different *weight*.  Larger objects tend to be
  heavier.  Color also makes a difference.
* *Balance* - How is the image weighted.
* *Depth* - Does the image seem more three-dimensional or flat?  How
  do we achieve that sense.
* Successful images often carefully *draw the eye* across the image.
* *Context* - How does it speak to or draw upon the broader world?

Deck Wars
---------

We will look at a variety of images.  For each, we'll consider what 
design elements dominate.

*Disclaimer*: I found some of these analyses the most frustrating part
of my art history courses.

* Deck 1: Images from past sessions of CSC 151.
* Deck 2: Famous works of art, prepared by Matt Kluber for a previous
  session of this course.
