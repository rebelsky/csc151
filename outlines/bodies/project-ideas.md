Forming groups
--------------

* Ideally, you'll find a mix of skills - at least one person with design
  skills, one with coding skills, and one with "management" skills to keep
  the group together.  I may ask you to self-identify.
* Identify people with whom you would like to work.  If you need help 
  finding a group, let me know.

Making compelling images
------------------------

* See yesterday's notes.

Free time
---------

* Look at sample images.
* Play with MIST, if you desire.
* Do the lab.
* Ask me and the mentors questions.
