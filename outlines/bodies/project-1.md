Reviewing images: Big picture
-----------------------------

* We'll begin with a quick overview of all the images I recieved.
* Our mentors will choose the first set of images to explore.
* After we finish with one group's set of images, that group will choose
  the next set of images to explore.
* We'll continue until we run out of images or run out of time.
* If there's time left at the end, we'll debrief a bit.
* Reminder: We'll be talking about the code in the next class.

Reviewing images: Individual series
-----------------------------------

* Those who chose the series will indicate why they chose the series.
* The next 'volunteer' will say something positive about the series.
* The next 'volunteer' will indicate what design principles they see the
  designers exploring.
* The next 'volunteer' will describe any emotional responses the images
  evoke.  (You can choose just one.)
* The next 'volunteer' will suggest something that the designers might do
  to improve their images.
* The group will talk about design principles and the feelings they were
  trying to evoke.
* THe next 'volunteer' will ask the group one question.
