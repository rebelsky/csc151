The Subject Matter(s) of the Course
-----------------------------------

_I consider it important to end the semester with an overview of the
 primary learning goals and outcomes of the course, which we often
 call "the subject matter of the course."  I think of CSC 151 as having 
 a broad range of subject matters.  Here's the high-level overview._

* Problem Solving.  CSC 151 is about techniques for thinking about how
  to take a problem and develop a solution.
* Computer Science: Algorithms and Data Structures.  We use the approach
  of computer scientists, developing algorithms that solve generalized
  problems and arranging the data in certain ways.
* Scheme.  We make these issues concrete using the Scheme programming
  language.
* Program and Software Design.  And think more broadly about how to
  represent algorithms as programs.
* General Thinking Skills.  Every Grinnell class should develop skills
  beyond disciplinary skills.  We work on a wide variety.
* And Beyond.  I try to provide some moral perspective on the world,
  too.
