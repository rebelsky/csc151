A Bit About Design
------------------

* Many issues to consider, both formal and informal
* Formal attributes include things like balance, symmetry, dimensionality
* Informal goals
    * How does the image lead your eye?
    * Does the image maintain your viewer's interest, or is it easy to
      see and dismiss.
* Successful designers know how to take advantage of certain formal attributes
  to acheive various goals (including these informal goals)
* Right now, we're just going to look at some formal issues regarding color

Basics of Color Theory
----------------------

* Issue: Do we think in terms of paint (traditional) or in terms of light
  (computer/modern)?
* Three models
    * RGB - additive color, based on red, green, and blue lights
        * Adding colors makes things brighter - more light is transmitted
        * Often represented using a 0-255 (integer) or 0-1 (real) range.
    * Red, Yellow, Blue - subtractive color
        * Adding colors makes things darker - more light is absorbed
    * Hue, Saturation, Value
        * Hue is the underlying color
        * Value refers to lightness and darkness (high value is lighter)
        * Saturation refers to how much of the color we have (low
          saturation is closer to grey, high saturation is purer color)
        * We'll look at the color wheel to ground this understanding
            * [A color wheel](http://www.artsconnected.org/toolkit/encyc_colorwheel.html)
            * [A color cylinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HSV_color_solid_cylinder_alpha_lowgamma.png)
            * And we will play with some issues in lab tomorrow
* Working with RYB and the color wheel, we say that there are
    * Three *primary* colors: Red, Yellow, and Blue
    * Three *secondary* colors, created by combining the primaries.
    * Six *tertiary* colors, created by mixing a secondary with the
      neighboring primaries.
* We also assign temperature to colors: red colors are warmer, blue and
  green are cooloer
    * Temperature can also affect where in the plane you see something
* The ways you arrange colors affect the way you understand them.
    * Traditionally, there are ranges between harmonious and dischordant.
* Color schemes
    * Complementary - opposite on the color wheel
    * Analagous - three neighboring colors on the 12-color color wheel
    * Monochromatic - variations on one color (different hue/saturation)
    * We may take a quick look at the Color Scheme Designer

* Another clicker quiz!
* Some sample designs, taken from the Kluber version of Digital Design
