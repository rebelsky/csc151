Some General Issues
-------------------

* I don't reveal grade distributions as I see no point in doing so.
* A few general observations:
    * Don't hit your head against the wall.  I do (usually) answer questions,
      although sometimes with other questions.
    * You need to think a bit more broadly about possible inputs.  For example, 
      many people only tried `top-left` on images that were centered at (0,0).
    * Many of you did better on code, which you could check, rather than
      preconditions, postconditions, and tests, which you could not check.

Reflections
-----------

* We will try to make a list of strategies for dealing with CS take-home
  tests.
    * What are general approaches that worked (or that should work)?
    * What are things you did that you probably shouldn't have done?
    * How do you approach a new problem?
* Make a list of 3 "Do"s or "Don't"s.
* Share with a group of four or so.
* Share with the class.

Additional Questions and Answers
--------------------------------

* Time for things that you want to talk about.
