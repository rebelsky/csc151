Some General Issues
===================
* I don't reveal grade distributions as I see no point in doing so.
* Many of you need to work more on test-taking strategies.  
    * *Read the exam first*: Almost everyone who tried the last 
    question solved that question.
    * *Start early and take breaks*: In a few cases, it looked like
    you planned to do the whole exam in one four-hour stint (or two two-hour
    stints).  You often do better if you think about questions for a little
    bit and then come back to them.
    * *Ask Sam for help*: I don't mind answering questions on the
    exam, and sometimes a quick suggestion from me can make things much
    faster.

What is Functional Programming?
===============================
* I saw lots of citation problems.
* Some of you had trouble understanding the definitions, which makes sense.
* What did you see as the most important aspects of functional programming?

Tips on Other Problems
======================
* Problem 2: In the "how" part, we wanted you to say not just the
  steps in computation, but also why those steps resulted in the median.
* Problem 3: The result was supposed to include cents.  It also reveals
  a problem with Scheme's representation of reals.
* Problem 5: Finding the points could be straightforward if you're clever.
* Problems 8 and 9: We'll go over these.
