Overview
========
* When comparing algorithms, we often care which one is faster.
* We can analyze by hand.
* We can analyze by using a library written at Grinnell.
* We can carefully study the code and predict (covered in future CS courses)

Steps in Automating Analysis
============================
* Replace <code>define</code> with <code>define$</code>.
* Type <code>(analyze *exp* *procedure*)</code>
* Alternately, type <code>(analyze *exp*)</code>.
