About the Final

* In class.
* Written.
    * So like a really hard quiz.
* You may bring one page of notes (handwritten or computer written).
    * Evidence suggests that it has more benefit if it's hadnwritten.
* Comprehensive.
* Four problems.
* Four-problem grading format: 4 is an A, 3 is a B, 2 is a C, 1 is a D.
