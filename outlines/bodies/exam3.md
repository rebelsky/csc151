Sam's Questions
---------------

* Should I say "no" the next time students plead to get in to 151
  and it brings the class over 36?
* Why didn't anyone drop?  ("Melt" is typical in 151.)
* What's something I did really well?
* What's something I really need to improve (other than getting you
  graded work more quickly)?
* What else should I know?

About the Final
---------------

* In class.
* Written.
* You may bring one page of handwritten notes.
* Comprehensive.
* Four problems.
* Four-problem grading format: 4 is an A, 3 is a B, 2 is a C, 1 is a D.

Exam 3
------

* We'll consider any problems you have questions about.  
* But I'm unlikely to keep solutions posted.

Final Thoughts
--------------

* Ending the class is hard.
* I really did enjoy (attempting to) teach you.
