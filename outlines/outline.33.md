==================================

Held: Friday, 1 November 2013

Back to [Outline 32 - Geometric Art Through Numeric Recursion](outline.32.html).
On to [Outline 34 - Pairs and Pair Structures](outline.34.html).

**Summary**

We consider *characters* and *strings*, two basic types
in Scheme.  Strings are used to represent text in Scheme, and characters
are the building blocks of strings.
