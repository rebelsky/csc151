Outline 47: Insertion Sort
==========================

Held: Tuesday, 26 November 2013

Back to [Outline 46 - Introduction to Sorting](outline.46.html).
On to [Outline 48 - Merge Sort](outline.48.html).

**Summary**

We move from our general exploration of sorting to the implementation of
a particular sorting algorithm, *insertion sort*.  We also explore 
how the running time for that algorithm varies based on the number of
values we are sorting.

* Insertion sort basics.
* Four questions about insertion sort.
* Analyzing insertion sort.

**Administrivia**

* Note: The next time we have a fire alarm during a quiz, I'm not going to
  use the "everyone gets a ten" policy.
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities:
    * Tuesday, November 26, 4:15 p.m., JRC 209  a gaming event with the 
      game [d0x3d!]   Popcorn will be served.
    * Any self-care week activity during purgatory week.
    * _One Grinnell_ rally on December 4 at 4pm.

Preparation: A Few Questions on Insertion Sort
----------------------------------------------

* What is the key idea in insertion sort?
* How does insertion sort differ in lists and vectors?
* Why do we provide you with three different kinds of list-based insertion 
  sort (and four kinds of insertion sort)?

Lab
---

* Do [the lab on isertion sort](../Labs/insertion-sort-lab.html).
* Be prepared to reflect.
