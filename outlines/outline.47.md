Outline 47: Insertion Sort
==========================

Held: Tuesday, 26 November 2013

Back to [Outline 46 - Introduction to Sorting](outline.46.html).
On to [Outline 48 - Merge Sort](outline.48.html).

**Summary**

We move from our general exploration of sorting to the implementation of
a particular sorting algorithm, <em>insertion sort</em>.  We also explore 
how the running time for that algorithm varies based on the number of
values we are sorting.

===========================
* What is the key idea in insertion sort?
* How does insertion sort differ in lists and vectors?
* Why do we provide you with three different kinds of list-based insertion 
  sort (and four kinds of insertion sort)?
