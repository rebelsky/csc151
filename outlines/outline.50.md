Debriefing
==========
* What did you learn from yesterday's discussion?
* Do you want to discuss any other images?

Considering Project Code
========================
* We'll start looking at processes used to create these images.
    * You'll pick some images that you want to know about.
    * The authors will describe their code.
    * Once in a while, we'll even run it (if possible).
* If there's time, I'll pick on some of your code.
