Outline 27: Other Forms of List Recursion
=========================================

Held: Tuesday, 15 October 2013

Back to [Outline 26 - Recursion with Helper Procedures](outline.26.html).
On to [Outline 28 - Preconditions, Revisited](outline.28.html).

**Summary**

We conclude our initial forays into list recursion by looking for
some common patterns in the design of recursive procedures.

Questions and answers
---------------------

_What, if anything, is not currently making sense?_

Thinking about the brightest color
----------------------------------

* Why does the order of the colors matter?  Why does it matter so much?
* How many calls does the improved version do?  (No, the answer is not "one".)

Some key ideas from the reading
-------------------------------

* Once you've written a few procedures that are similar, step back and
  see if you can see a pattern.
    * You can then use the pattern to write similar procedures
    * Sometimes the pattern will help you improve your code
