Outline 42: Analyzing Procedures
================================

Held: Monday, 18 November 2013

Back to [Outline 41 - Visit from Hilary Mason](outline.41.html).
On to [Outline 43 - Association Lists](outline.43.html).

**Summary**

We consider techniques for analyzing the number of calls made in
evaluating procedures, particularly recursive procedures.

**Overview**

* Comparing algorithms.
* Two related metrics: Time and Number of steps.
* Counting procedure calls by printing.
* Tools for analysis.

**Administrivia**

* Any thoughts on the HMason presentations?
* Grade info distributed.  Sorry that I couldn't do better, but I did spend
  over twenty hours this weekend either grading or working on class prep.
* I'll reserve time at the start of class for questions on the projects.
* Today's lab writeup: 5d
* Optional fun reading  on the Digital Commons

Overview
--------

* When comparing algorithms, we often care which one is faster.
* We can analyze by hand.
* We can analyze by using a library written at Grinnell.
* We can carefully study the code and predict (covered in future CS courses)
