============================

Held: Friday, 20 September 2013

Back to [Outline 12 - Raster Graphics and RGB Colors](outline.12.html).

**Summary**

We pause to reflect on issues that we've recently explored.

**Overview**

* About documentation.
* Other recent issues.

**Administrivia**

* Warning!  Class 13 falls on a Friday this year.  (It's not quite as bad
  as Friday the 13th, but it's close.)
* We're keeping lab partners for one more day.
* If you send me email that you want me to look at, please title it
  something like QUESTION or HELP or something similar.  If you title
  it "CSC 151 Homework", I'll probably just file it in my "to grade
  later" folder.
* Mentors and tutors
    * Sunday night mentor session moved to 7pm
    * Mentor sessions are focused times - The mentors will answer questions,
      but they've also usually prepared some activities to help you learn.
      They also know the class really well.
    * Tutoring times are a chance to ask assorted questions, but the tutors
      won't know things as well and may have less time to spend with you.
* Lab Writeups
    * Typically one or two problems.
    * Due before the next class period (with some slack for those due
      Tuesday and Wednesday)
    * When grading labs, I'll generally add a few notes and then say
      something like "fine" or "acceptable".  (Or perhaps "unacceptable",
      if it's unacceptable.)  I then record either 1 or 0.
    * When submitting labs, please title your email something like 
      "CSC 151.02 Lab Writeup *N*: *Title*".  (No quotation marks)
        * Today's should be "CSC 151.02 Lab Writeup 4: Transforming RGB Colors"
* Grading
    * Distributed last night.  Our email system worries that I'm a spammer
      and delays some grades.  I watched email cross.  
    * If you have zeros and shouldn't let me know.
    * I'll send updated grade info after I grade the quizzes and try to make it
      a policy to send out updated grade info each time I grade something
      of reasonable size.
* It sounds like there may be room for one or two more people to switch
  to Dr. Davis's section, but the form probably has to go in today.
* Today is the add/drop deadline.  
    * You can still drop after today, but after today a "W" appears on your transcript.
    * I did not and would not design the system this way.
* Notation issues
    * A dash is traditionally used between words in Scheme names.
    * An arrow, as in `drawing->image` is traditionally used for transforming
      one thing to another.
    * An exclamation point, as in `image-select-rectangle!` is used to
      indicate that the procedure changes one or more of its parameters.
    * A question mark, as in `drawing-rectangle?` is used to ask a
      true/false question.
    * We try to name many procedures with the type they work with.
      So <code>image-select-rectangle!</code> expects an image.
      (The notation is not perfect.)
* Work for Monday
    * Think about the exam
    * Reading for Monday: [Transforming Images](../readings/transforming-images-reading.html)
    * Lab writeup 4: Problems 6a and 7b from Transforming RGB Colors.  
      Due before class on Monday
* EC Opportunities:
    * CS Extras Thursday @ 4:30: Jennelle Nystrom on working at Microsoft
    * CS Table next Friday (The Story of Mel)
    * Other?
* And more administrative stuff!
    * A bit more about documentation
    * Questions before the quiz
    * Quiz
    * Questions about the exam
