Outline 32: Geometric Art Through Numeric Recursion
===================================================

Held: Wednesday, 30 October 2013

Back to [Outline 31 - Numeric Recursion](outline.31.html).
On to [Outline 33 - Characters and Strings](outline.33.html).

**Summary**

We use the techniques that we've learned so far (particularly numeric
recursion and GIMP drawing tools) to build some interesting regular
images.  (You can decide whether or not it's "art".)
