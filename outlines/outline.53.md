Outline 53: Project Assessment: Algorithms
==========================================

Held: Monday, 9 December 2013

Back to [Outline 52 - Project Assessment: Images](outline.52.html).
On to [Outline 54 - What is Computer Science? Revisited](outline.54.html).

**Summary**

We continue our exploration of the project by considering some of the
coding techniques used.

**Overview**

* Debriefing from previous class.
* Students discuss programming techniques.

**Administrivia**

* I will reserve time for questions on [Exam 3](../assignments/exam.03.html).
* Study break tonight 8-10.  Smoothies!  (May run out, so get there early.)
    * Yes, 151 students are welcome to attend CS study breaks!
* Upcoming extra credit opportunities:
    * CS Extras Thursday at 4:30: Mediascripting
    * CS Table Friday: TBD.

Debriefing
----------

* What did you learn from yesterday's discussion?
* Do you want to discuss any other images?

Considering Project Code
------------------------

* We'll start looking at processes used to create these images.
    * You'll pick some images that you want to know about.
    * The authors will describe their code.
    * Once in a while, we'll even run it (if possible).
* If there's time, I'll pick on some of your code.
