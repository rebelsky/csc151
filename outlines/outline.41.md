Outline 41: Analyzing Procedures
================================

Held: Friday, 15 November 2013

Back to [Outline 40 - Project Kickoff](outline.40.html).
On to [Outline 42 - Association Lists](outline.42.html).

**Summary**

We consider techniques for analyzing the number of calls made in
evaluating procedures, particularly recursive procedures.

**Overview**

* Comparing algorithms.
* Two related metrics: Time and Number of steps.
* Counting procedure calls by printing.
* Tools for analysis.

**Administrivia**


Overview
========
* When comparing algorithms, we often care which one is faster.
* We can analyze by hand.
* We can analyze by using a library written at Grinnell.
* We can carefully study the code and predict (covered in future CS courses)

Steps in Automating Analysis
============================
* Replace <code>define</code> with <code>define$</code>.
* Type <code>(analyze *exp* *procedure*)</code>
* Alternately, type <code>(analyze *exp*)</code>.
